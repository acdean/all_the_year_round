<title>Over The Way</title>
<p>
I <sc>HAD</sc> been living at Tunbridge Wells and 
nowhere else, going on for ten years, when 
my medical man--very clever in his profession, 
and the prettiest player I ever saw 
in my life of a hand at Long Whist, 
which was a noble and a princely game 
before Short was heard of--said to me, one 
day, as he sat feeling my pulse on the 
actual sofa which my poor dear sister Jane 
worked before her spine came on, and laid her 
on a board for fifteen months at a stretch--
the most upright woman that ever lived--
said to me, "What we want, ma'am, is a fillip." 
</p>
<p>
"Good gracious, goodness gracious, Doctor 
Towers" says I, quite startled at the man, 
for he was so christened himself: "don't talk 
as if you were alluding to people's names; but 
say what you mean." 
</p>
<p>
"I mean, my dear ma'am, that we want a 
little change of air and scene." 
</p>
<p>
"Bless the man!" said I; "does he mean 
we or me!" 
</p>
<p>
"I mean you, ma'am." 
</p>
<p>
"Then Lard, forgive you, Doctor Towers," 
I said; "why don't you get into a habit of 
expressing yourself in a straightforward 
manner, like a loyal subject of our gracious 
Queen Victoria, and a member of the Church 
of England?" 
</p>
<p>
Towers laughed, as he generally does when 
he has fidgetted me into any of my impatient 
ways--one of my states, as I call them--and 
then he began,--
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
"Tone, ma'am, Tone, is all you require!" 
He appealed to Trottle, who just then came 
in with the coal-scuttle, looking, in his nice 
black suit, like an amiable man putting on 
coals from motives of benevolence. 
</p>
<p>
Trottle (whom I always call my right 
hand) has been in my service two and thirty 
years. He entered rny service, far away from 
England. He is the best of creatures, and 
the most respectable of me; but, 
opinionated. 
</p>
<p>
"What you want, ma'am," says Trottle, 
making up the fire in his quiet and skilful 
way, "is Tone." 
</p>
<p>
"Lard forgive you both!" says I, bursting 
out a-laughing; "I see you are in a 
conspiracy against me, so I suppose you must do 
what you like with me, and take me to 
London for a change." 
</p>
<p>
For some weeks Towers had hinted at 
London, and consequently I was prepared 
for him. When we had got to this point, we 
got on so expeditiously, that Trottle was 
packed off to London next day but one, to 
find some sort of place for me to lay my 
troublesome old head in. 
</p>
<p>
Trottle came back to me at the Wells after 
two days' absence, with accounts of a charming 
place that could be taken for six months 
certain, with liberty to renew on the same 
terms for another six, and which really did 
afford every accommodation that I wanted. 
</p>
<p>
"Could you really find no fault at all in 
the rooms, Trottle?" I asked him. 
</p>
<p>
"Not a single one, ma'am. They are 
exactly suitable to you. There is not a fault 
in them. There is but one fault outside of 
them." 
</p>
<p>
"And what's that?" 
</p>
<p>
"They are opposite a House to Let." 
</p>
<p>
"O!" I said, considering of it. "But is that 
such a very great objection?" 
</p>
<p>
"I think it my duty to mention it, ma'am. 
It is a dull object to look at. Otherwise, I 
was so greatly pleased with the lodging that 
I should have closed with the terms at once, 
as I had your authority to do." 
</p>
<p>
Trottle thinking so highly of the place, in 
my interest, I wished not to disappoint him. 
Consequently I said: 
</p>
<p>
"The empty House may let, perhaps." 
</p>
<p>
"O, dear no, ma'am," said Trottle, shaking 
his head with decision; "it won't let. It 
never does let, ma'am." 
</p>
<p>
"Mercy me! Why not?" 
</p>
<p>
"Nobody knows, ma'am. All I have to 
mention is, ma'am, that the House won't let?" 
</p>
<p>
"How long has this unfortunate House 
been to let, in the name of Fortune?" 
said I. 
</p>
<p>
"Ever so long," said Trottle. "Years." 
</p>
<p>
"Is it in ruins?" 
</p>
<p>
"It's a good deal out of repair, ma'am, but 
it's not in ruins." 
</p>
<p>
The long and the short of this business 
was, that next day I had a pair of post-horses 
put to my chariot for, I never travel 
by railway: not that I have anything to say 
against railways, except that they came in 
when I was too old to take to them; and 
that they made ducks and drakes of a few 
turnpike-bonds I had and so I went up 
myself, with Trottle in the rumble, to look at 
the inside of this same lodging, and at the 
outside of this same House. 
</p>
<p>
As I say, I went and saw for myself. 
The lodging was perfect. That, I was 
sure it would be; because Trottle is the 
best judge of comfort I know. The empty 
house was an eyesore; and that I was sure 
it would be too, for the same reason. However, 
setting the one thing against the 
other, the good against the bad, the lodging 
very soon got the victory over the House. 
My lawyer, Mr. Squares, of Crown Office 
Row, Temple, drew up an agreement; which 
his young man jabbered over so dreadfully 
when he read it to me, that I didn't 
understand one word of it except my own name; 
and hardly that, and I signed it, and the 
other party signed it, and, in three weeks' 
time, I moved my old bones, bag and baggage, 
up to London. 
</p>
<p>
For the first month or so, I arranged to 
leave Trotlle at the Wells. I made this 
arrangement, not only because there was a 
good deal to take care of in the way of my 
school-children and pensioners, and also of a 
new stove in the hall to air the house in my 
absence, which appeared to me calculated to 
blow up and burst; but, likewise because I 
suspect Trottle (though the steadiest of men, 
and a widower between sixty and seventy) 
to be what I call rather a Philanderer, 
mean, that when any friend comes down to 
see me and brings a maid, Trottle is always 
remarkably ready to show that maid the 
Wells of an evening; and that I have more 
than once noticed the shadow of his arm, 
outside the room door nearly opposite my 
chair, encircling that maid's waist on the 
landing, like a table-cloth brush. 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, I thought it just as well, before 
any London Philandering took place, that I 
should have a little time to look round me, 
and to see what girls were in and about the 
place. So, nobody stayed with me in my new 
lodging at first after Trottle had established 
me there safe and sound, but Peggy 
Flobbins, my maid; a most affectionate and attached 
woman, who never was an object of 
Philandering since I have known her, and is 
not likely to begin to become so after nine-and-twenty 
years next March. 
</p>
<p>
It was the fifth of November when I first 
breakfasted in my new rooms. The Guys 
were going about in the brown fog, like magnified 
monsters of insects in table-beer, and 
there was a Guy resting on the doorsteps of 
the House to Let. I put on my glasses, partly 
to see how the boys were pleased with what 
I sent them out by Peggy, and partly 
to make sure that she didn't approach 
too near the ridiculous object, which of 
course was full of sky-rockets, and might go 
off into bangs at any moment. In this way 
it happened that the first time I ever looked 
at the House to Let, after I became its opposite 
neighbour, I had my glasses on. And 
this might not have happened once in fifty 
times, for my sight is uncommonly good for 
my time of life; and I wear glasses as little 
as I can, for fear of spoiling it. 
</p>
<p>
I knew already that it was a ten-roomed 
house, very dirty and much dilapidated; that 
the area-rails were rusty and peeling away, 
and that two or three of them were wanting, 
or half-wanting; that there were broken 
panes of glass in the windows, and blotches 
of mud on other panes, which the boys had 
thrown at them; that there was quite a 
collection of stones in the area, also 
proceeding from those Young Mischiefs; that there 
were games chalked on the pavement before 
the house, and likenesses of ghosts chalked 
on the street-door; that the windows were 
all darkened by rotting old blinds, or shutters, 
or both; that the bills "To Let," had curled 
up, as if the damp air of the place had given 
them cramps; or had dropped down into 
corners, as if they were no more. I had seen 
all this on my first visit, and I had remarked 
to Trottle, that the lower part of the black 
board about terms was split away; that 
the rest had become illegible, and that the 
very stone of the door-steps was broken 
across. Notwithstanding, I sat at my breakfast 
table on that Please to Remember the 
fifth of November morning, staring at the 
House through my glasses, as if I had never 
looked at it before. 
</p>
<p>
All at once--in the first-floor window on my 
right--down in a low corner, at a hole in a 
blind or a shutter I found that I was looking 
at a secret Eye. The reflection of my 
fire may have touched it and made it shine; 
but, I saw it shine and vanish. 
</p>
<p>
The eye might have seen me, or it might 
not have seen me, sitting there in the glow 
of my fire--you can take which probability 
you prefer, without offence--but something 
struck through my frame, as if the sparkle of 
this eye had been electric, and had flashed 
straight at me. It had such an effect upon 
me, that I could not remain by myself, and I 
rang for Flobbins, and invented some little 
jobs for her, to keep her in the room. After 
my breakfast was cleared away, I sat in the 
same place with my glasses on, moving my 
head, now so, and now so, trying whether, 
with the shining of my fire and the flaws in 
the window-glass, I could re-produce any 
sparkle seeming to be up there, that was like 
the sparkle of an eye. But no; I could make 
nothing like it. I could make ripples and 
crooked lines in the front of the House to 
Let, and I could even twist one window up 
and loop it into another; but, I could make 
no eye, nor anything like an eye. So I convinced 
myself that I really had seen an eye. 
</p>
<p>
Well, to be sure I could not get rid of the 
impression of this eye, and it troubled me 
and troubled me, until it was almost a 
torment. I don't think I was previously 
inclined to concern my head much about 
the opposite House; but, after this eye, my 
head was full of the house; and I thought 
of little else than the house, and I watched 
the house, and I talked about the house, and 
I dreamed of the house. In all this, I fully 
believe now, there was a good Providence. 
But, you will judge for yourself about that, 
bye-and-bye. 
</p>
<p>
My landlord was a butler, who had married 
a cook, and set up housekeeping. They had 
not kept house longer than a couple of years, 
and they knew no more about the House to 
Let than I did. Neither could I find out 
anything concerning it among the tradespeople 
or otherwise; further than what 
Trottle had told me at first. It had been 
empty, some said six years, some said eight, 
some said ten. It never did let, they all 
agreed, and it never would let. 
</p>
<p>
I soon felt convinced that I should work 
myself into one of my states about the House; 
and I soon did. I lived for a whole month 
in a flurry, that was always getting worse. 
Towers's prescriptions, which I had brought 
to London with me, were of no more use 
than nothing. In the cold winter sunlight, 
in the thick winter fog, in the black winter 
rain, in the white winter snow, the House 
was equally on my mind. I have heard, as 
everybody else has, of a spirit's haunting a 
house; but I have had my own personal 
experience of a house's haunting a spirit; for 
that House haunted mine. 
</p>
<p>
In all that month's time, I never saw anyone 
go into the House nor come out of the 
House. I supposed that such a thing must 
take place sometimes, in the dead of the 
night, or the glimmer of the morning; but, I 
never saw it done. I got no relief from 
having my curtains drawn when it came on 
dark, and shutting out the house. The Eye 
then began to shine in my fire. 
</p>
<p>
I am a single old woman. I should say 
at once, without being at all afraid of the 
name, I am an old maid; only that I am older 
than the phrase would express. The time 
was when I had my love-trouble, but, it is 
long and long ago. He was killed at sea 
(Dear Heaven rest his blessed head!) when 
I was twenty-five. I have all my life, since 
ever I can remember, been deeply fond of 
children. I have always felt such a love for 
them, that I have had my sorrowful and 
sinful times when I have fancied something 
must have gone wrong in my life--something 
must have been turned aside from its original 
intention I mean--or I should have been the 
proud and happy mother of many children, 
and a fond old grandmother this day. I have 
soon known better in the cheerfulness and 
contentment that God has blessed me with 
and given me abundant reason for; and yet 
I have had to dry my eyes even then, when I 
have thought of my dear, brave, hopeful, handsome, 
bright-eyed Charley, and the trust he 
meant to cheer me with. Charley was my 
youngest brother, and he went to India. 
He married there, and sent his gentle little 
wife home to me to be confined, and she was 
to go back to him, and the baby was to be 
left with me, and I was to bring it up. It 
never belonged to this life. It took its silent 
place among the other incidents in my story 
that might have been, but never were. I had 
hardly time to whisper to her "Dead my 
own!" or she to answer, "Ashes to ashes, 
dust to dust! O lay it on my breast and comfort 
Charley!" when she had gone to seek 
her baby at Our Saviour's feet. I went to 
Charley, and I told him there was nothing 
left but me, poor me; and I lived with Charley, 
out there, several years. He was a man of 
fifty, when he fell asleep in my arms. His 
face had changed to be almost old and a little 
stern; but, it softened, and softened when I 
laid it down that I might cry and pray beside 
it; and, when I looked at it for the last time, 
it was my dear, untroubled, handsome, youthful 
Charley of long ago. 
</p>
<p>
--I was going on to tell that the loneliness 
of the House to Let brought back all these 
recollections, and that they had quite pierced 
my heart one evening, when Flobbins, opening 
the door, and looking very much as if she 
wanted to laugh but thought better of it, 
said: 
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Jabez Jarber, ma'am!" 
</p>
<p>
Upon which Mr. Jarber ambled in, in his 
usual absurd way, saying: 
</p>
<p>
"Sophonisba!" 
</p>
<p>
Which I am obliged to confess is my name. 
A pretty one and proper one enough when it 
was given to me: but, a good many years out 
of date now, and always sounding particularly 
high-flown and comical from his lips. So I 
said, sharply: 
</p>
<p>
"Though it is Sophonisba, Jarber, you are 
not obliged to mention it, that <em>I</em> see." 
</p>
<p>
In reply to this observation, the ridiculous 
man put the tips of my five right-hand fingers 
to his lips, and said again, with an 
aggravating accent on the third syllable: 
</p>
<p>
"Sophonisba!" 
</p>
<p>
I don't burn lamps, because I can't abide 
the smell of oil, and wax candles belonged 
to my day. I hope the convenient 
situation of one of my tall old candlesticks on 
the table at my elbow will be my excuse for 
saying, that if he did that again, I would chop 
his toes with it. (I am sorry to add that 
when I told him so, I knew his toes to be 
tender.) But, really, at my time of life and 
at Jarber's, it is too much of a good thing. 
There is an orchestra still standing in the 
open air at the Wells, before which, in the 
presence of a throng of fine company, I have 
walked a minuet with Jarber. But, there is 
a house still standing, in which I have worn 
a pinafore, and had a tooth drawn by 
fastening a thread to the tooth and the door-handle, 
and toddling away from the door. And how 
should I look now, at my years, in a pinafore, 
or having a door for my dentist? 
</p>
<p>
Besides, Jarber always was more or less an 
absurd man. He was sweetly dressed, and 
beautifully perfumed, and many girls of my 
day would have given their ears for him; 
though I am bound to add that he never 
cared a fig for them, or their advances either, 
and that he was very constant to me. For, 
he not only proposed to me before my 
love-happiness ended in sorrow, but afterwards 
too: not once, nor yet twice: nor will we say 
how many times. However many they were, 
or however few they were, the last time he 
paid me that compliment was immediately 
after he had presented me with a digestive 
dinner-pill stuck on the point of a pin. And 
I said on that occasion, laughing heartily, 
"Now, Jarber, if you don't know that two 
people whose united ages would make about 
a hundred and fifty, have got to be old, I do; 
and I beg to swallow this nonsense in the 
form of this pill," (which I took on the spot), 
"and I request to hear no more of it." 
</p>
<p>
After that, he conducted himself pretty 
well. He was always a little squeezed man, 
was Jarber, in little sprigged waistcoats; 
and he had always little legs and a little 
smile, and a little voice, and little roundabout 
ways. As long as I can remember 
him he was always going little errands 
for people, and carrying little gossip. At 
this present time when he called me 
"Sophonisba!" he had a little old-fashioned 
lodging in that new neighbourhood of mine. 
I had not seen him for two or three years, 
but I had heard that he still went out with a 
little perspective-glass and stood on doorsteps 
in Saint James's Street, to see the 
nobility go to Court; and went in his little 
cloak and goloshes outside Willis's rooms to 
see them go to Almack's; and caught the 
frightfullest colds, and got himself trodden 
upon by coachmen and linkmen, until he 
went home to his landlady a mass of bruises, 
and had to be nursed for a month. 
</p>
<p>
Jarber took off his little fur-collared cloak, 
and sat down opposite me, with his little cane 
and hat in his hand. 
</p>
<p>
"Let us have no more Sophonisbaing, if 
you please, Jarber," I said. "Call me Sarah. 
How do you do? I hope you are pretty 
well." 
</p>
<p>
"Thank you. And you?" said Jarber. 
</p>
<p>
"I am as well as an old woman can 
expect to be." 
</p>
<p>
Jarber was beginning: 
</p>
<p>
"Say, not old, Sophon--" but I looked 
at the candlestick, and he left off; pretending 
not to have said anything. 
</p>
<p>
"I am infirm, of course," I said, "and so 
are you. Let us both be thankful it's no 
worse." 
</p>
<p>
"Is it possible that you look worried?" 
said Jarber. 
</p>
<p>
"It is very possible. I have no doubt it is 
the fact." 
</p>
<p>
"And what has worried my Soph--, 
soft-hearted friend," said Jarber. 
</p>
<p>
"Something not easy, I suppose, to 
comprehend. I am worried to death by a House 
to Let, over the way." 
</p>
<p>
Jarber went with his little tip-toe step to 
the window-curtains, peeped out, and looked 
round at me. 
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said I, in answer: "that house." 
</p>
<p>
After peeping out again, Jarber came back 
to his chair with a tender air, and asked: 
"How does it worry you, S--arah?" 
</p>
<p>
"It is a mystery to me," said I. "Of course 
every house is a mystery, more or less; but, 
something that I don't care to mention" (for 
truly the Eye was so slight a thing to 
mention that I was more than half ashamed of it), 
"has made that House so mysterious to me, 
and has so fixed it in my mind, that I have 
had no peace for a month. I foresee that I 
shall have no peace, either, until Trottle 
comes to me, next Monday." 
</p>
<p>
I might have mentioned before, that there 
is a long-standing jealousy between Trottle 
and Jarber; and that there is never any love 
lost between those two. 
</p>
<p>
"<em>Trottle</em>" petulantly repeated Jarber, with 
a little flourish of his cane; "how is <em>Trottle</em> 
to restore the lost peace of Sarah?" 
</p>
<p>
"He will exert himself to find out something 
about the House. I have fallen into 
that state about it, that I really must 
discover by some means or other, good or bad, 
fair or foul, how and why it is that that 
House remains To Let." 
</p>
<p>
"And why Trottle? Why not," putting his 
little hat to his heart; "why not, Jarber?" 
</p>
<p>
"To tell you the truth, I have never 
thought of Jarber in the matter. And now 
I do think of Jarber, through your having 
the kindness to suggest him--for which I 
am really and truly obliged to you--I don't 
think he could do it." 
</p>
<p>
"Sarah!" 
</p>
<p>
"I think it would be too much for you, 
Jarber." 
</p>
<p>
"Sarah!" 
</p>
<p>
"There would be coming and going, and 
fetching and carrying, Jarber, and you might 
catch cold." 
</p>
<p>
"Sarah! What can be done by Trottle, 
can be done by me. I am on terms of 
acquaintance with every person of 
responsibility in this parish. I am intimate at the 
Circulating Library. I converse daily with 
the Assessed Taxes. I lodge with the Water 
Rate. I know the Medical Man. I lounge 
habitually at the House Agent's. I dine with 
the Churchwardens. I move to the Guardians. 
Trottle! A person in the sphere of a 
domestic, and totally unknown to society!" 
</p>
<p>
"Don't be warm, Jarber. In mentioning 
Trottle, I have naturally relied on my Right-Hand, 
who would take any trouble to gratify 
even a whim of his old mistress's. But, if 
you can find out anything to help to unravel 
the mystery of this House to Let, I shall be 
fully as much obliged to you as if there was 
never a Trottle in the land." 
</p>
<p>
Jarber rose and put on his little cloak. A 
couple of fierce brass lions held it tight round 
his little throat; but a couple of the mildest 
Hares might have done that, I am sure. 
"Sarah," he said, "I go. Expect me on 
Monday evening, the Sixth, when perhaps 
you will give me a cup of tea; may I ask 
for no Green? Adieu!" 
</p>
<p>
This was on a Thursday, the second of 
December. When I reflected that Trottle 
would come back on Monday, too, I had 
my misgivings as to the difficulty of keeping 
the two powers from open warfare, and 
indeed I was more uneasy than I quite 
like to confess. However, the empty House 
swallowed up that thought next morning, as 
it swallowed up most other thoughts now, 
and the House quite preyed upon me all that 
day, and all the Saturday. 
</p>
<p>
It was a very wet Sunday: raining and 
blowing from morning to night. When 
the bells rang for afternoon church, they 
seemed to ring in the commotion of the 
puddles as well as in the wind, and they 
sounded very loud and dismal indeed, and 
the street looked very dismal indeed, and 
the House looked dismallest of all. 
</p>
<p>
I was reading my prayers near the light, 
and my fire was glowing in the darkening 
window-glass, when, looking up, as I prayed 
for the fatherless children and widows and 
all who were desolate and oppressed, I 
saw the Eye again. It passed in a moment, 
as it had done before; but, this time, I was 
inwardly more convinced that I had seen it. 
</p>
<p>
Well to be sure, I <em>had</em> a night that night! 
Whenever I closed my own eyes, it was 
to see eyes. Next morning, at an unreasonably 
and I should have said (but for that 
railroad) an impossibly early hour, comes 
Trottle. As soon as he had told me all 
about the Wells, I told him all about the 
House. He listened with as great interest 
and attention as I could possibly wish, until 
I came to Jabez Jarber, when he cooled in 
an instant, and became opinionated. 
</p>
<p>
"Now, Trottle," I said, pretending not to 
notice, "when Mr. Jarber comes back this 
evening, we must all lay our heads 
together." 
</p>
<p>
"I should hardly think that would be 
wanted, ma'am; Mr. Jarber's head is surely 
equal to anything." 
</p>
<p>
Being determined not to notice, I said 
again, that we must all lay our heads 
together. 
</p>
<p>
"Whatever you order, ma'am, shall be 
obeyed. Still, it cannot be doubted, I should 
think, that Mr. Jarber's head is equal, if not 
superior, to any pressure that can be brought 
to bear upon it." 
</p>
<p>
This was provoking; and his way, when 
he came in and out all through the day, of 
pretending not to see the House to Let, 
was more provoking still. However, being 
quite resolved not to notice, I gave no sign 
whatever that I did notice. But, when 
evening came, and he showed in Jarber, 
and, when Jarber wouldn't be helped off 
with his cloak, and poked his cane into cane 
chair-backs and china ornaments and his own 
eye, in trying to unclasp his brazen lions of 
himself (which he couldn't do, after all) I 
could have shaken them both. 
</p>
<p>
As it was, I only shook the tea-pot, and 
made the tea. Jarber had brought from 
under his cloak, a roll of paper, with which 
he had triumphantly pointed over the way, 
like the Ghost of Hamlet's father appearing 
to the late Mr. Kernble, and which he had laid 
on the table. 
</p>
<p>
"A discovery?" said I, pointing to it, 
when he was seated, and had got his teacup. 
"Don't go, Trottle." 
</p>
<p>
"The first of a series of discoveries," 
answered Jarber. "Account of a former 
tenant, compiled from the Water-Rate, and 
Medical Man." 
</p>
<p>
"Don't go, Trottle," I repeated. For, I 
saw him making imperceptibly to the door. 
</p>
<p>
"Begging your pardon, ma'am, I might be 
in Mr. Jarber's way?" 
</p>
<p>
Jarber looked that he decidedly thought he 
might be. I relieved myself with a good 
angry croak, and said--always determined 
not to notice: 
</p>
<p>
"Have the goodness to sit down, if you 
please, Trottle. I wish you to hear this." 
</p>
<p>
Trottle bowed in the stiffest manner, and 
took the remotest chair he could find. Even 
that, he moved close to the draught from 
the keyhole of the door. 
</p>
<p>
"Firstly," Jarber began, after sipping his 
tea, "would my Sophon--" 
</p>
<p>
"Begin again, Jarber," said I. 
</p>
<p>
"Would you be much surprised, if this 
House to Let, should turn out to be the 
property of a relation of your own?" 
</p>
<p>
"I should indeed be very much surprised." 
</p>
<p>
"Then it belongs to your first cousin (I 
learn, by the way, that he is ill at this time) 
George Forley." 
</p>
<p>
"Then that is a bad beginning. I cannot 
deny that George Forley stands in the 
relation of first cousin to me; but I hold no 
communication with him. George Forley has 
been a hard, bitter, stony father to a child 
now dead. George Forley was most 
implacable and unrelenting to one of his two 
daughters who made a poor marriage. George 
Forley brought all the weight of his hand to 
bear as heavily against that crushed thing, as 
he brought it to bear lightly, favouringly, and 
advantageously upon her sister, who made a 
rich marriage. I hope that, with the measure 
George Forley meted, it may not be measured 
out to him again. I will give George Forley 
no worse wish." 
</p>
<p>
I was strong upon the subject, and I could 
not keep the tears out of my eyes; for, that 
young girl's was a cruel story, and I had 
dropped many a tear over it before. 
</p>
<p>
"The house being George Forley's," said 
I, "is almost enough to account for there 
being a Fate upon it, if Fate there is. Is 
there anything about George Forley in those 
sheets of paper?" 
</p>
<p>
"Not a word." 
</p>
<p>
"I am glad to hear it. Please to read on. 
Trottle, why don't you come nearer? Why 
do you sit mortifying yourself in those Arctic 
regions? Come nearer." 
</p>
<p>
"Thank you, ma'am; I am quite near 
enough to Mr. Jarber." 
</p>
<p>
Jarber rounded his chair, to get his back 
full to my opinionated friend and servant, and, 
beginning to read, tossed the words at him 
over his (Jabez Jarber's) own ear and 
shoulder. 
</p>
<p>
He read what follows:

<title>The Manchester Marriage.</title>
<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Openshaw came from 
Manchester to London and took the House To 
Let. He had been, what is called in 
Lancashire, a Salesman for a large manufacturing 
firm, who were extending their 
business, and opening a warehouse in London; 
where Mr. Openshaw was now to superintend 
the business. He rather enjoyed the change 
of residence; having a kind of curiosity about 
London, which he had never yet been able to 
gratify in his brief visits to the metropolis. 
At the same time he had an odd, shrewd, 
contempt for the inhabitants; whom he had 
always pictured to himself as fine, lazy 
people; caring nothing but for fashion and 
aristocracy, and lounging away their days in 
Bond Street, and such places; ruining good 
English, and ready in their turn to despise 
him as a provincial. The hours that the 
men of business kept in the city scandalised 
him too; accustomed as he was to the early 
dinners of Manchester folk, and the 
consequently far longer evenings. Still, he 
was pleased to go to London; though he 
would not for the world have confessed it, 
even to himself, and always spoke of 
the step to his friends as one demanded of 
him by the interests of his employers, and 
sweetened to him by a considerable increase 
of salary. His salary indeed was so liberal 
that he might have been justified in taking a 
much larger House than this one, had he not 
thought himself bound to set an example to 
Londoners of how little a Manchester man of 
business cared for show. Inside, however, 
he furnished the House with an unusual 
degree of comfort, and, in the wintertime, he 
insisted on keeping up as large fires as the 
grates would allow, in every room where the 
temperature was in the least chilly. Moreover, 
his northern sense of hospitality was 
such, that, if he were at home, he could hardly 
suffer a visitor to leave the house without 
forcing meat and drink upon him. Every 
servant in the house was well warmed, well 
fed, and kindly treated; for their master 
scorned all petty saving in aught that 
conduced to comfort; while he amused himself 
by following out all his accustomed habits 
and individual ways in defiance of what any 
of his new neighbours might think. 
</p>
<p>
His wife was a pretty, gentle woman, of 
suitable age and character. He was forty-two, 
she thirty-five. He was loud and decided; she 
soft and yielding. They had two children; or 
rather, I should say, she had two; for the 
elder, a girl of eleven, was Mrs. Openshaw's 
child by Frank Wilson her first husband. The 
younger was a little boy, Edwin, who could 
just prattle, and to whom his father delighted 
to speak in the broadest and most unintelligible 
Lancashire dialect, in order to keep up 
what he called the true Saxon accent. 
</p>
<p>
Mrs.Openshaw's Christian-name was Alice, 
and her first husband had been her own 
cousin. She was the orphan niece of a sea-captain 
in Liverpool: a quiet, grave little 
creature, of great personal attraction when 
she was fifteen or sixteen, with regular 
features and a blooming complexion. But she 
was very shy, and believed herself to be very 
stupid and awkward; and was frequently 
scolded by her aunt, her own uncle's second 
wife. So when her cousin, Frank Wilson, 
came home from a long absence at sea, and 
first was kind and protective to her; secondly, 
attentive; and thirdly, desperately in love 
with her, she hardly knew how to be grateful 
enough to him. It is true she would have 
preferred his remaining in the first or second 
stages of behaviour; for his violent love 
puzzled and frightened her. Her uncle neither 
helped nor hindered the love affair: though 
it was going on under his own eyes. Frank's 
step-mother had such a variable temper, that 
there was no knowing whether what she 
liked one day she would like the next, or not. 
At length she went to such extremes of 
crossness, that Alice was only too glad to shut 
her eyes and rush blindly at the chance of 
escape from domestic tyranny offered her by 
a marriage with her cousin; and, liking him 
better than any one in the world except her 
uncle (who was at this time at sea) she went 
off one morning and was married to him; her 
only bridesmaid being the housemaid at her 
aunt's. The consequence was, that Frank 
and his wife went into lodgings, and Mrs. 
Wilson refused to see them, and turned away 
Norah, the warm-hearted housemaid; whom 
they accordingly took into their service. 
When Captain Wilson returned from his 
voyage, he was very cordial with the young 
couple, and spent many an evening at their 
lodgings; smoking his pipe, and sipping his 
grog; but he told them that, for quietness' 
sake, he could not ask them to his own house; 
for his wife was bitter against them. They 
were not very unhappy about this. 
</p>
<p>
The seed of future unhappiness lay rather 
in Frank's vehement, passionate disposition; 
which led him to resent his wife's shyness and 
want of demonstration as failures in conjugal 
duty. He was already tormenting himself, 
and her too, in a slighter degree, by 
apprehensions and imaginations of what might 
befal her during his approaching absence at 
sea. At last he went to his father and urged 
him to insist upon Alice's being once more 
received under his roof; the more especially as 
there was now a prospect of her confinement 
while her husband was away on his voyage. 
Captain Wilson was, as he himself expressed 
it, "breaking up," and unwilling to undergo 
the excitement of a scene; yet he felt that 
what his son said was true. So he went to his 
wife. And before Frank went to sea, he had 
the comfort of seeing his wife installed in her 
old little garret in his father's house. To have 
placed her in the one best spare room was a 
step beyond Mrs. Wilson's powers of submission 
or generosity. The worst part about it, 
however, was that the faithful Norah had to 
be dismissed. Her place as housemaid had 
been filled up; and, even had it not, she had 
forfeited Mrs. Wilson's good opinion for ever. 
She comforted her young master and mistress 
by pleasant prophecies of the time when they 
would have a household of their own; of 
which, in whatever service she might be in 
the meantime, she should be sure to form 
part. Almost the last action Frank Wilson 
did, before setting sail, was going with Alice 
to see Norah once more at her mother's house. 
And then he went away. 
</p>
<p>
Alice's father-in-law grew more and more 
feeble as winter advanced. She was of great 
use to her step-mother in nursing and amusing 
him; and, although there was anxiety enough 
in the household, there was perhaps more of 
peace than there had been for years; for 
Mrs. Wilson had not a bad heart, and was 
softened by the visible approach of death to 
one whom she loved, and touched by the 
lonely condition of the young creature, 
expecting her first confinement in her husband's 
absence. To this relenting mood Norah owed 
the permission to come and nurse Alice when 
her baby was born, and to remain to attend 
on Captain Wilson. 
</p>
<p>
Before one letter had been received from 
Frank (who had sailed for the East Indies 
and China), his father died. Alice was 
always glad to remember that he had 
held her baby in his arms, and kissed and 
blessed it before his death. After that, and 
the consequent examination into the state of 
his affairs, it was found that he had left far 
less property than people had been led by 
his style of living to imagine; and, what 
money there was, was all settled upon his 
wife, and at her disposal after her death. 
This did not signify much to Alice, as Frank 
was now first mate of his ship, and, in another 
voyage or two, would be captain. Meanwhile 
he had left her some hundreds (all his 
savings) in the bank. 
</p>
<p>
It became time for Alice to hear from her 
husband. One letter from the Cape she had 
already received. The next was to announce 
his arrival in India. As week after week 
passed over, and no intelligence of the ship's 
arrival reached the office of the owners, and 
the Captain's wife was in the same state of 
ignorant suspense as Alice herself, her fears 
grew most oppressive. At length the day 
came when, in reply to her inquiry at the 
Shipping Office, they told her that the owners 
had given up hope of ever hearing more of 
the Betsy-Jane, and had sent in their claim 
upon the Underwriters. Now that he was 
gone for ever, she first felt a yearning, longing 
love for the kind cousin, the dear friend, 
the sympathising protector, whom she should 
never see again,--first felt a passionate desire 
to show him his child, whom she had hitherto 
rather craved to have all to herself--her own 
sole possession. Her grief was, however, 
noiseless, and quiet rather to the scandal of 
Mrs. Wilson; who bewailed her step-son as 
if he and she had always lived together in 
perfect harmony, and who evidently thought 
it her duty to burst into fresh tears at every 
strange face she saw; dwelling on his poor 
young widow's desolate state, and the helplessness 
of the fatherless child, with an 
unction, as if she liked the excitement of the 
sorrowful story. 
</p>
<p>
So passed away the first days of Alice's 
widowhood. Bye-and-bye things subsided into 
their natural and tranquil course. But, as if 
this young creature was always to be in some 
heavy trouble, her ewe-lamb, began to be 
ailing, pining and sickly. The child's 
mysterious illness turned out to be some affection 
of the spine likely to affect health; but not to 
shorten life--at least so the doctors said. 
But the long dreary suffering of one whom 
a mother loves as Alice loved her only child, 
is hard to look forward to. Only Norah 
guessed what Alice suffered; no one but God 
knew. 
</p>
<p>
And so it fell out, that when Mrs. Wilson, 
the elder, came to her one day in violent 
distress, occasioned by a very material diminution 
in the value of the property that her 
husband had left her,--a diminution which 
made her income barely enough to support 
herself, much less Alice--the latter could 
hardly understand how anything which did 
not touch health or life could cause such grief; 
and she received the intelligence with 
irritating composure. But when, that afternoon, 
the little sick child was brought in, and the 
grandmother--who after all loved it well--
began a fresh moan over her losses to its 
unconscious ears--saying how she had planned 
to consult this or that doctor, and to give it 
this or that comfort or luxury in after years, 
but that now all chance of this had passed 
away--Alice's heart was touched, and she 
drew near to Mrs. Wilson with unwonted 
caresses, and, in a spirit not unlike to that of 
Ruth, entreated, that come what would, they 
might remain together. After much 
discussion in succeeding days, it was arranged 
that Mrs. Wilson should take a house in 
Manchester, furnishing it partly with what 
furniture she had, and providing the rest with 
Alice's remaining two hundred pounds. Mrs. 
Wilson was herself a Manchester woman, and 
naturally longed to return to her native town; 
Some connexions of her own at that time 
required lodgings, for which they were willing to 
pay pretty handsomely. Alice undertook the 
active superintendence and superior work of 
the household. Norah, willing faithful Norah, 
offered to cook, scour, do anything in short, 
so that she might but remain with them. 
</p>
<p>
The plan succeeded. For some years their 
first lodgers remained with them, and all 
went smoothly, with the one sad exception 
of the little girl's increasing deformity. How 
that mother loved that child, is not for words 
to tell! 
</p>
<p>
Then came a break of misfortune. Their 
lodgers left, and no one succeeded to them. 
After some months they had to remove to a 
smaller house; and Alice's tender conscience 
was torn by the idea that she ought not to be 
a burden to her mother-in-law, but ought to 
go out and seek her own maintenance. And 
leave her child! The thought came like the 
sweeping boom of a funeral bell over her 
heart. 
</p>
<p>
Bye-and-bye, Mr. Openshaw came to lodge 
with them. He had started in life as the 
errand-boy and sweeper-out of a warehouse; 
had struggled up through all the grades of 
employment in the place, fighting his way 
through the hard striving Manchester life 
with strong pushing energy of character. 
Every spare moment of time had been sternly 
given up to self-teaching. He was a capital 
accountant, a good French and German 
scholar, a keen, far-seeing, tradesman; 
understanding markets, and the bearing of 
events, both near and distant, on trade: and 
yet, with such vivid attention to present 
details, that I do not think he ever saw a 
group of flowers in the fields without thinking 
whether their colours would, or would not, 
form harmonious contrasts in the coming 
spring muslins and prints. He went to 
debating societies, and threw himself with all 
his heart and soul into politics; esteeming, it 
must be owned, every man a fool or a knave 
who differed from him, and overthrowing his 
opponents rather by the loud strength of his 
language than the calm strength of his logic. 
There was something of the Yankee in all 
this. Indeed his theory ran parallel to the 
famous Yankee motto "England flogs creation, 
and Manchester flogs England." Such 
a man, as may be fancied, had had no time 
for falling in love, or any such nonsense. At 
the age when most young men go through 
their courting and matrimony, he had not the 
means of keeping a wife, and was far too 
practical to think of having one. And now 
that he was in easy circumstances, a rising 
man, he considered women almost as 
incumbrances to the world, with whom a man 
had better have as little to do as possible. 
His first impression of Alice was indistinct, 
and he did not care enough about her to make 
it distinct. "A pretty yea-nay kind of woman," 
would have been his description of her, if he 
had been pushed into a corner. He was rather 
afraid, in the beginning, that her quiet ways 
arose from a listlessness and laziness of 
character which would have been exceedingly 
discordant to his active energetic nature. 
But, when he found out the punctuality with 
which his wishes were attended to, and her 
work was done; when he was called in the 
morning at the very stroke of the clock, his 
shaving-water scalding hot, his fire bright, 
his coffee made exactly as his peculiar fancy 
dictated, (for he was a man who had his 
theory about everything, based upon what he 
knew of science, and often perfectly original)--
then he began to think: not that Alice 
had any peculiar merit; but that he had got 
into remarkably good lodgings: his restlessness 
wore away, and he began to consider 
himself as almost settled for life in them. 
</p>
<p>
Mr. Openshaw had been too busy, all his 
life, to be introspective. He did not know 
that he had any tenderness in his nature; 
and if he had become conscious of its abstract 
existence, he would have considered it as a 
manifestation of disease in some part of 
his nature. But he was decoyed into pity 
unawares; and pity led on to tenderness. That 
little helpless child always carried about 
by one of the three busy women of the house, 
or else patiently threading coloured beads in 
the chair from which, by no effort of its 
own, could it ever move; the great grave 
blue eyes, full of serious, not uncheerful, 
expression, giving to the small delicate face a 
look beyond its years; the soft plaintive voice 
dropping out but few words, so unlike the 
continual prattle of a child--caught Mr. Openshaw's 
attention in spite of himself. One 
day--he half scorned himself for doing so--
he cut short his dinner-hour to go in search 
of some toy which should take the place of 
those eternal beads. I forget what he bought; 
but, when he gave the present (which he 
took care to do in a short abrupt manner, 
and when no one was by to see him) he was 
almost thrilled by the flash of delight that 
came over that child's face, and could not 
help all through that afternoon going over 
and over again the picture left on his memory, 
by the bright effect of unexpected joy on the 
little girl's face. When he returned home, 
he found his slippers placed by his sitting-room 
fire; and even more careful attention 
paid to his fancies than was habitual in those 
model lodgings. When Alice had taken the 
last of his tea-things away--she had been 
silent as usual till then--she stood for an 
instant with the door in her hand. Mr. 
Openshaw looked as if he were deep in his 
book, though in fact he did not see a line; 
but was heartily wishing the woman would 
be gone, and not make any palaver of gratitude. 
But she only said: 
</p>
<p>
"I am very much obliged to you, Sir. 
Thank you very much," and was gone, even 
before he could send her away with a "There, 
my good woman, that's enough!" 
</p>
<p>
For some time longer he took no apparent 
notice of the child. He even hardened his 
heart into disregarding her sudden flush of 
colour and little timid smile of recognition, 
when he saw her by chance. But, after all, 
this could not last for ever; and, having a 
second time given way to tenderness, there 
was no relapse. The insidious enemy having 
thus entered his heart, in the guise of 
compassion to the child, soon assumed the 
more dangerous form of interest in the 
mother. He was aware of this change of 
feeling, despised himself for it, struggled 
with it; nay, internally yielded to it and 
cherished it, long before he suffered the 
slightest expression of it, by word, action, or 
look, to escape him. He watched Alice's 
docile obedient ways to her stepmother; 
the love which she had inspired in the 
rough Norah (roughened by the wear and 
tear of sorrow and years); but above all, 
he saw the wild, deep, passionate affection 
existing between her and her child. They 
spoke little to any one else, or when any one 
else was by; but, when alone together, they 
talked, and murmured, and cooed, and 
chattered so continually, that Mr. Openshaw first 
wondered what they could find to say to 
each other, and next became irritated because 
they were always so grave and silent with 
him. All this time, he was perpetually 
devising small new pleasures for the child. 
His thoughts ran, in a pertinacious way, upon 
the desolate life before her; and often he 
came back from his day's, work loaded with 
the very thing Alice had been longing for, 
but had not been able to procure. One time 
it was a little chair for drawing the little 
sufferer along the streets, and many an 
evening that ensuing summer Mr. Openshaw 
drew her along himself, regardless 
of the remarks of his acquaintances. One 
day in autumn he put down his newspaper, 
as Alice came in with the breakfast, and 
said, in as indifferent a voice as he could 
assume: 
</p>
<p>
"Mrs. Frank, is there any reason why we 
two should not put up our horses together?" 
</p>
<p>
Alice stood still in perplexed wonder. 
What did he mean? He had resumed the 
reading of his newspaper, as if he did not 
expect any answer; so she found silence her 
safest course, and went on quietly arranging 
his breakfast without another word passing 
between them. Just as he was leaving the 
house, to go to the warehouse as usual, he 
turned back and put his head into the bright, 
neat, tidy kitchen, where all the women 
breakfasted in the morning: 
</p>
<p>
"You'll think of what I said, Mrs. Frank" 
(this was her name with the lodgers), 
"and let me have your opinion upon it 
tonight." 
</p>
<p>
Alice was thankful that her mother and 
Norah were too busy talking together to 
attend much to this speech. She determined 
not to think about it at all through the day; 
and, of course, the effort not to think, made 
her think all the more. At night she sent up 
Norah with his tea. But Mr. Openshaw almost 
knocked Norah down as she was going out 
at the door, by pushing past her and calling 
out "Mrs. Frank!" in an impatient voice, 
at the top of the stairs. 
</p>
<p>
Alice went up, rather than seem to have 
affixed too much meaning to his words. 
</p>
<p>
"Well, Mrs. Frank," he said, "what 
answer? Don't make it too long; for I have 
lots of office work to get through to-night." 
</p>
<p>
"I hardly know what you meant, Sir," 
said truthful Alice. 
</p>
<p>
"Well! I should have thought you might 
have guessed. You're not new at this sort of 
work, and I am. However, I'll make it 
plain this time. Will you have me to be 
thy wedded husband, and serve me, and love 
me, and honour me, and all that sort of 
thing? Because, if you will, I will do as 
muoh by you, and be a father to your child 
and that's more than is put in the prayer-book. 
Now, I'm a man of my word; and 
what I say, I feel; and what I promise, I'll 
do. Now, for your answer!" 
</p>
<p>
Alice was silent. He began to make the 
tea, as if her reply was a matter of perfect 
indifference to him; but, as soon as that was 
done, he became impatient. 
</p>
<p>
"Well?" said he. 
</p>
<p>
"How long, sir, may I have to think over 
it?" 
</p>
<p>
"Three minutes!" (looking at his watch). 
"You've had two already that makes five. 
Be a sensible woman, say Yes, and sit down 
to tea with me, and we'll talk it over 
together; for, after tea, I shall be busy; say 
No" (he hesitated a moment to try and keep 
his voice in the same tone), "and I shan't say 
another word about it, but pay up a year's 
rent for my rooms to-morrow, and be off. 
Time's up! Yes or no?" 
</p>
<p>
"If you please, sir,--you have been so good 
to little Ailsie--" 
</p>
<p>
"There, sit down comfortably by me on the 
sofa, and let us have our tea together. I am 
glad to find you are as good and sensible as I 
took you for." 
</p>
<p>
And this was Alice Wilson's second wooing. 
</p>
<p>
Mr. Openshaw's will was too strong, and 
his circumstances too good, for him not 
to carry all before him. He settled Mrs. 
Wilson in a comfortable house of her own, 
and made her quite independent of lodgers. 
The little that Alice said with regard to 
future plans was in Norah's behalf. 
</p>
<p>
"No," said Mr. Openshaw. "Norah shall 
take care of the old lady as long as she lives; 
and, after that, she shall either come and 
live with us, or, if she likes it better, she 
shall have a provision for life for your 
sake, missus. No one who has been good to 
you or the child shall go unrewarded. 
But even the little one will be better for 
some fresh stuff about her. Get her a bright, 
sensible girl as a nurse: one who won't go 
rubbing her with calf's-foot jelly as Norah 
does; wasting good stuff outside that ought 
to go in, but will follow doctors' directions; 
which, as you must see pretty clearly by this 
time, Norah won't; because they give the 
poor little wench pain. Now, I'm not above 
being nesh for other folks myself. I can 
stand a good blow, and never change colour; 
but, set me in the operating-room in the 
infirmary, and I turn as sick as a girl. Yet, 
if need were, I would hold the little wench 
on my knees while she screeched with pain, 
if it were to do her poor back good. Nay, 
nay, wench! keep your white looks for the 
time when it comes--I don't say it ever will. 
But this I know, Norah will spare the child 
and cheat the doctor if she can. Now, I say, 
give the bairn a year or two's chance, and 
then, when the pack of doctors have done 
their best--and, maybe, the old lady has 
gone--we'll have Norah back, or do better 
for her." 
</p>
<p>
The pack of doctors could do no good to 
little Ailsie. She was beyond their power. But 
her father (for so he insisted on being called, 
and also on Alice's no longer retaining the 
appellation of Mama, but becoming 
henceforward Mother), by his healthy cheerfulness 
of manner, his clear decision of purpose, his 
odd turns and quirks of humour, added to 
his real strong love for the helpless little 
girl, infused a new element of brightness and 
confidence into her life; and, though her 
back remained the same, her general health 
was strengthened, and Alice--never going 
beyond a smile herself--had the pleasure of 
seeing her child taught to laugh. 
</p>
<p>
As for Alice's own life, it was happier 
than it had ever been. Mr. Openshaw 
required no demonstration, no expressions of 
affection from her. Indeed, these would 
rather have disgusted him. Alice could 
love deeply, but could not talk about it. 
The perpetual requirement of loving word, 
looks, and caresses, and misconstruing their 
absence into absence of love, had been the 
great trial of her former married life, Now, 
all went on clear and straight, under the 
guidance of her husband's strong sense, warm 
heart, and powerful will. Year by year 
their worldly prosperity increased. At Mrs. 
Wilson's death, Norah came back to them, 
as nurse to the newly-born little Edwin; 
into which post she was not installed without 
a pretty strong oration on the part of 
the proud and happy father; who declared 
that if he found out that Norah ever tried 
to screen the boy by a falsehood, or to 
make him nesh either in body or mind, 
she should go that very day. Norah 
and Mr. Openshaw were not on the most 
thoroughly cordial terms; neither of them 
fully recognising or appreciating the other's 
best qualities. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
This was the previous history of the 
Lancashire family who had now removed 
to London, and had come to occupy the 
House. 
</p>
<p>
They had been there about a year, when 
Mr. Openshaw suddenly informed his wife that 
he had determined to heal long-standing feuds, 
and had asked his uncle and aunt Chadwick 
to come and pay them a visit and see London. 
Mrs. Openshaw had never seen this uncle and 
aunt of her husband's. Years before she 
had married him, there had been a quarrel. 
All she knew was, that Mr. Chadwick was 
a small manufacturer in a country town 
in South Lancashire. She was extremely 
pleased that the breach was to be healed, 
and began making preparations to render 
their visit pleasant. 
</p>
<p>
They arrived at last. Going to see London 
was such an event to them, that Mrs. 
Chadwick had made all new linen fresh for the 
occasion from night-caps downwards; and, 
as for gowns, ribbons, and collars, she 
might have been going into the wilds of 
Canada where never a shop is, so large was 
her stock. A fortnight before the day of her 
departure for London, she had formally 
called to take leave of all her acquaintance; 
saying she should need all the intermediate 
time for packing up. It was like a second 
wedding in her imagination; and, to complete 
the resemblance which an entirely new wardrobe 
made between the two events, her husband 
brought her back from Manchester, on 
the last market-day before they set off, a 
gorgeous pearl and amethyst brooch, saying, 
"Lunnon should see that Lancashire folks 
knew a handsome thing when they saw it." 
</p>
<p>
For some time after Mr. and Mrs. Chadwick 
arrived at the Openshaws', there was no 
opportunity for wearing this brooch; but at 
length they obtained an order to see 
Buckingham Palace, and the spirit of loyalty 
demanded that Mrs. Chadwick should wear 
her best clothes in visiting the abode of her 
sovereign. On her return, she hastily changed 
her dress; for Mr. Openshaw had planned 
that they should go to Richmond, drink tea 
and return by moonlight. Accordingly, about 
five o'clock, Mr. and Mrs. Openshaw and Mr. 
and Mrs. Chadwick set off. 
</p>
<p>
The housemaid and cook sate below, 
Norah hardly knew where. She was always 
engrossed in the nursery, in tending her two 
children, and in sitting by the restless, 
excitable Ailsie till she fell asleep. Bye-and-bye, 
the housemaid Bessy tapped gently at the 
door. Norah went to her, and they spoke in 
whispers. 
</p>
<p>
"Nurse! there's some one down-stairs 
wants you." 
</p>
<p>
"Wants me! Who is it?" 
</p>
<p>
"A gentleman" 
</p>
<p>
"A gentleman? Nonsense!" 
</p>
<p>
"Well! a man, then, and he asks for you, 
and he rung at the front door bell, and has 
walked into the dining-room." 
</p>
<p>
"You should never have let him," 
exclaimed Norah, "master and missus out" 
</p>
<p>
"I did not want him to come in; but, 
when he heard you lived here, he walked 
past me, and sat down on the first chair, 
and said, 'Tell her to come and speak to me.' 
There is no gas lighted in the room, and 
supper is all set out." 
</p>
<p>
"He'll be off with the spoons!" exclaimed 
Norah, putting the housemaid's fear into 
words, and preparing to leave the room, first, 
however, giving a look to Ailsie, sleeping 
soundly and calmly. 
</p>
<p>
Down-stairs she went, uneasy fears stirring 
in her bosom. Before she entered the 
dining-room she provided herself with a candle, and, 
with it in her hand, she went in, looking round 
her in the darkness for her visitor. 
</p>
<p>
He was standing up, holding by the table. 
Norah and he looked at each other; gradual 
recognition coming into their eyes. 
</p>
<p>
"Norah?" at length he asked. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
"Who are you?" asked Norah, with the 
sharp tones of alarm and incredulity. "I 
don't know you:" trying, by futile words of 
disbelief, to do away with the terrible fact 
before her. 
</p>
<p>
"Am I so changed?" he said, pathetically. 
"I daresay I am. But, Norah, tell me!" 
he breathed hard, "where is my wife? Is 
she is she alive?" 
</p>
<p>
He came nearer to Norah, and would have 
taken her hand; but she backed away from 
lookig at him all the time with 
staring eyes, as if he were some horrible 
object. Yet he was a handsome, bronzed, 
good-lookign fellow, with beard and 
moustache, giving him a foreign-looking aspect; 
but his eyes! there was no mistaking those 
eager, beautiful eyes--the very same that 
Norah had watched not half-an-hour ago, till 
sleep stole softly over them. 
</p>
<p>
"Tell me, Norah--I can bear it--I have 
feared it so often. Is she dead?" Norah still 
kept silence. "She is dead!" He hung on 
Norah's words and looks, as if for confirmation 
or contradiction. 
</p>
<p>
"What shall I do?" groaned Norah. "O, 
sir! why did you come? how did you find 
me out? where have you been? We thought 
you dead, we did, indeed!" She poured out 
words and questions to gain time, as if time 
would help her. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
"Norah! answer me this question straight, 
by yes or no--Is my wife dead?" 
</p>
<p>
"No, she is not!" said Norah, slowly and 
heavily. 
</p>
<p>
"0, what a relief! Did she receive my 
letters? But perhaps you don't know. Why 
did you leave her? Where is she? O, 
Norah, tell me all quickly!" 
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Frank!" said Norah at last, almost 
driven to bay by her terror lest her mistress 
should return at any moment, and find him 
there--unable to consider what was best 
to be done or said--rushing at something 
decisive, because she could not endure her 
present state: "Mr. Frank! we never heard 
a line from you, and the shipowners said you 
had gone down, you and every one else. We 
thought you were dead, if ever man was, and 
poor Miss Alice and her little sick, helpless 
child! O, sir, you must guess it," cried the 
poor creature at last, bursting out into a 
passionate fit of crying, "for indeed I cannot 
tell it. But it was no one's fault. God help 
us all this night!" 
</p>
<p>
Norah had sate down. She trembled too 
much to stand, He took her hands in his. 
He squeezed them hard, as if by physical 
pressure, the truth could be wrung out. 
</p>
<p>
"Norah!" This time his tone was calm, 
stagnant as despair. "She has married 
again!" 
</p>
<p>
Norah shook her head sadly. The grasp 
slowly relaxed. The man had fainted. 
</p>
<p>
There was brandy in the room. Norah 
forced some drops into Mr. Frank's mouth, 
chafed his hands, and--when mere animal life 
returned, before the mind poured in its flood 
of memories and thoughts--she lifted him up, 
and rested his head against her knees. Then 
she put a few crumbs of bread taken from 
the supper-table, soaked in brandy into his 
mouth. Suddenly he sprang to his feet. 
</p>
<p>
"Where is she? Tell me this instant." 
He looked so wild, so mad, so desperate, that 
Norah felt herself to be in bodily danger; 
but her time of dread had gone by. She had 
been afraid to tell him the truth, and then 
she had been a coward. Now, her wits were 
sharpened by the sense of his desperate state. 
He must leave the house. She would pity 
him afterwards; but now she must rather 
command and upbraid; for he must leave 
the house before her mistress came home. 
That one necessity stood clear before her. 
</p>
<p>
"She is not here: that is enough for you 
to know. Nor can I say exactly where she 
is" (which was true to teh letter if not to 
the spirit). "Go away, adn tell me where 
to find you to-morrow, and I will tell you 
all. My master and mistress may come 
back at any minute, and then what would 
become of me with a strange man in the 
house?" 
</p>
<p>
Such an argument was too petty to touch 
his excited mind. 
</p>
<p>
"I don't care for your master and mistress. 
If your master is a man, he must feel for me--
poor shipwrecked sailor that I am--kept 
for years a prisoner amongst savages, always, 
always, always thinking of my wife and my 
home--dreaming of her by night, talking to 
her, though she could not hear, by day. I 
loved her more than all heaven and earth 
put together. Tell me where she is, this 
instant, you wretched woman, who salved 
over her wickedness to her, as you do to me." 
</p>
<p>
The clock struck ten. Desperate positions 
require desperate measures. 
</p>
<p>
"If you will leave the house now, I will 
come to you to-morrow and tell you all. 
What is more, you shall see your child now. 
She lies sleeping up-stairs. O, sir, you 
have a child, you do not know that as yet--
a little weakly girl--with just a heart and 
soul beyond her years. We have reared her 
up with such care. We watched her, for 
we thought for many a year she might die 
any day, and we tended her, and no hard 
thing has come near her, and no rough word 
has ever been said to her. And now you 
come and will take her life into your hand, 
and will crush it. Strangers to her have 
been kind to her; but her own father--
Mr. Frank, I am her nurse, and I love her, 
and I tend her, and I would do anything for 
her that I could. Her mother's heart beats 
as hers beats; and, if she suffers a pain, her 
mother trembles all over. If she is happy, 
it is her mother that smiles and is glad. If 
she is growing stronger, her mother is 
healthy: if she dwindles, her mother languishes. 
If she dies--well, I don't know: 
it is not every one can lie down and die when 
they wish it. Come up-stairs, Mr. Frank, 
and see your child. Seeing her will do good 
to your poor heart. Then go away, in God's 
name, just this one night--to-morrow, if need 
be, you can do anything--kill us all if you 
will, or show yourself a great grand man, 
whom God will bless for ever and ever. 
Come, Mr. Frank, the look of a sleeping child 
is sure to give peace." 
</p>
<p>
She led him up-stairs; at first almost helping 
his steps, till they came near the nursery 
door. She had almost forgotten the existence 
of little Edwin. It struck upon her with 
affright as the shaded light fell upon the 
other cot; but she skilfully threw that corner 
of the room into darkness, and let the light 
fall on the sleeping .Ailsie. The child had 
thrown down the coverings, and her deformity, 
as she lay with her back to them, was 
plainly visible through her slight night-gown. 
Her little face, deprived of the lustre of her 
eyes, looked wan and pinched, and had a 
pathetic expression in it, even as she slept. 
The poor father looked and looked with 
hungry, wistful eye., into which the big tears 
came swelling up slowly, and dropped heavily . 
down, aa he stood trembling and shaking all 
over. Norah was angry with herself for 
growing impatient of the length of time that 
long lingering gaze lasted. She thought that 
she waited for full half-an-hour before Frank 
stirred. And then--instead of going away--
he sank down on his knees by the bedside, 
and buried his face in the clothes. Little 
Ailsie stirred uneasily. Norah pulled him up 
in terror. She could afford no more time even 
for prayer in her extremity of fear; for surely 
the next moment would bring her mistress 
home. She took him forcibly by the arm; 
but, as he was going, his eye lighted on the 
other bed: he stopped. Intelligence came 
back into his face. His hands clenched. 
</p>
<p>
"His child?" he asked. 
</p>
<p>
"Her child," replied Norah. "God watches 
over him," said she instinctively; for Frank's 
looks excited her fears, and she needed to 
remind herself of the Protector of the helpless. 
</p>
<p>
"God has not watched over me," he said, 
in despair; his thoughts apparently recoiling 
on his own desolate, deserted state. But 
Norah had no time for pity. To-morrow she 
would be as compassionate as her heart 
prompted. At length she guided him 
downstairs and shut the outer door and bolted it--
as if by bolts to keep out facts. 
</p>
<p>
Then she went back into the dining-room 
and effaced all traces of his presence as far as 
she could. She went up-stairs to the nursery 
and sate there, her head on her hand, thinking 
what was to come of all this misery. It 
seemed to her very long before they did 
return; yet it was hardly eleven o'clock. She 
heard the loud, hearty Lancashire voices on 
the stairs; and, for the first time, she understood 
the contrast of the desolation of the 
poor man who had so lately gone forth in 
lonely despair. 
</p>
<p>
It almost put her out of patience to see 
Mrs. Openshaw come in, calmly smiling, 
handsomely dressed, happy, easy, to inquire 
after her children. 
</p>
<p>
"Did Ailsie go to (sleep comfortably?" 
she whispered to Norah. 
</p>
<p>
"Yes." 
</p>
<p>
Her mother bent over her, looking at her 
slumbers with the soft eyes of love. How 
little she dreamed who had looked on her 
last! Then she went to Edwin, with 
perhaps less wistful anxiety in her countenance, 
but more of pride. She took off her 
things, to go down to supper. Norah saw 
her no more that night. 
</p>
<p>
Beside the door into the passage, the sleeping-nursery 
opened out of Mr. and Mrs. 
Openshaw's room, in order that they might 
have the children more immediately under 
their own eyes. Early the next summer 
morning Mrs. Openshaw was awakened by 
Ailsie's startled call of "Mother! mother!" 
She sprang up, put on her dressing-gown, 
and went to her child. Ailsie was only half 
awake, and in a not uncommon state of 
terror. 
</p>
<p>
"Who was he, mother? Tell me?" 
</p>
<p>
"Who, my darling? No one is here. You 
have been dreaming love. Waken up quite. 
See, it is broad daylight." 
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said Ailsie, looking round her; then 
clinging to her mother, said, "but a man 
was here in the night, mother." 
</p>
<p>
"Nonsense, little goose. No man has ever 
come near you!" 
</p>
<p>
"Yes, he did. He stood there. Just by 
Norah. A man with hair and a beard. And 
he knelt down and said his prayers. Norah 
knows he was here, mother" (half angrily, as 
Mrs. Openshaw shook her head in smiling 
incredulity). 
</p>
<p>
"Well! we will ask Norah when she 
comes," said Mrs. Openshaw, soothingly. 
"But we won't talk any more about him 
now. It is not five o'clock; it is too early for 
you to get up. Shall I fetch you a book and 
read to you?" 
</p>
<p>
"Don't leave me, mother," said the child, 
clinging to her. So Mrs. Openshaw sate on the 
bedside talking to Ailsie, and telling her of 
what they had done at Richmond the evening 
before, until the little girl's eyes slowly 
closed and she once more fell asleep. 
</p>
<p>
"What was the matter?" asked Mr. 
Openshaw, as his wife returned to bed. 
</p>
<p>
"Ailsie, wakened up in a fright, with some 
story of a man having been in the room to 
say his prayers,--a dream, I suppose." And 
no more was said at the time. 
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Openshaw had almost forgotten the 
whole affair when she got up about seven 
o'clock. But, bye-and-bye, she heard a sharp 
altercation going on in the nursery. Norah 
speaking angrily to Ailsie, a most unusual 
thing. Both Mr. and Mrs. Openshaw listened 
in astonishment. 
</p>
<p>
"Hold your tongue, Ailsie! let me hear 
none of your dreams; never let me hear you 
tell that story again!" Ailsie began to cry. 
</p>
<p>
Mr. Openshaw opened the door of 
communication before his wife could say a 
word. 
</p>
<p>
"Norah, come here!" 
</p>
<p>
The nurse stood at the door, defiant. 
She perceived she had been heard, but she 
was desperate. 
</p>
<p>
"Don't let me hear you speak in that 
manner to Ailsie again," he said sternly, and 
shut the door. 
</p>
<p>
Norah was infinitely relieved; for she had 
dreaded some questioning; and a little blame 
for sharp speaking was what she could well 
bear, if cross examination was let alone. 
</p>
<p>
Down-stairs they went, Mr. Openshaw 
carrying Ailsie; the sturdy Edwin coming 
step by step, right foot foremost, always holding 
his mother's hand. Each child was 
placed in a chair by the breakfast-table, and 
then Mr. and Mrs. Openshaw stood together 
at the window, awaiting their visitors' 
appearance and making plans for the day. 
There was a pause. Suddenly Mr. Openshaw 
turned to Ailsie, and said: 
</p>
<p>
"What a little goosy somebody is with 
her dreams, waking up poor, tired 
mother in the middle of the night with a 
story of a man being in the room.' 
</p>
<p>
"Father! I'm sure I saw him," said Ailsie, 
half crying. "I don't want to make Norah 
angry; but I was not asleep, for all she says 
I was. I had been asleep, and I awakened 
up quite wide awake though I was so 
frightened. I kept my eyes nearly shut, and I saw 
the man quite plain. A great brown man with 
a beard. He said his prayers. And then he 
looked at Edwin. And then Norah took him 
by the arm and led him away, after they had 
whispered a bit together." 
</p>
<p>
"Now, my little woman must be reasonable," 
said Mr. Openshaw, who was always 
patient with Ailsie. "There was no man in 
the house last night at all. No man comes into 
the house as you know, if you think; much 
less goes up into the nursery. But sometimes 
we dream something has happened, and the 
dream is so like reality, that you are not the 
tirst person, little woman, who has stood out 
that the thing has really happened." 
</p>
<p>
"But, indeed it was not a dream!" said 
Ailsie beginning to cry. 
</p>
<p>
Just then Mr. and Mrs. Chadwick came 
down, looking grave and discomposed. All 
during breakfast time they were silent and 
uncomfortable. As soon as the breakfast 
things were taken away, and the children 
had been carried up-stairs, Mr. Chadwick 
began in an evidently preconcerted manner 
to inquire if his nephew was certain that 
all his servants were honest; for, that 
Mrs. Chadwick had that morning missed a 
very valuable brooch, which she had worn 
the day before. She remembered taking it 
off when she came home from Buckingham 
Palace. Mr. Openshaw's face contracted into 
hard lines: grew like what it was before he 
had known his wife and her child. He rang 
the bell even before his uncle had done speaking. 
It was answered by the housemaid. 
</p>
<p>
"Mary, was any one here last night while 
we were away?" 
</p>
<p>
"A man, sir, came to speak to Norah." 
</p>
<p>
"To speak to Norah! Who was he? How 
long did he stay?" 
</p>
<p>
"I'm sure I can't tell, sir. He came--
perhaps about nine. I went up to tell Norah 
iu the nursery, and she came down to speak 
to him. She let him out, sir. She will know 
who he was, and how long he stayed." 
</p>
<p>
She waited a moment to be asked any 
more questions, but she was not, so she went 
away. 
</p>
<p>
A minute afterwards Openshaw made as 
though he were going out of the room; but 
his wife laid her hand on his arm: 
</p>
<p>
"Do not speak to her before the children," 
she said, in her low quiet, voice. "I will go 
up and question her." 
</p>
<p>
"No! I must speak to her. You must 
know," said he, turning to his uncle and 
aunt, "my missus has an old servant, as 
faithful as ever "woman was, I do believe, as 
far as love goes,--but, at the same time, who 
does not always speak truth, as even the 
missus must allow. Now, ray notion is, that 
this Norah of ours has been come over by some 
good-for-nothing chap (for she's at the time 
o'life when they say women pray for 
husbands--'any, good Lord, any,') and has let 
him into our house, and the chap has made off 
witlh your brooch, and m'appen many another 
tiling beside. It's only saying that Norah is 
soft-hearted, and does not stick at a white lie--
that's all, missus." 
</p>
<p>
It was curious to notice how his tone, his 
eyes, his whole face changed as he spoke to 
his wife; but he was the resolute man 
through all. She knew better than to oppose 
him; so she went up-stairs, and told Norah 
her master wanted to speak to her, and that 
she would take care of the children in the 
meanwhile. 
</p>
<p>
Norah rose to go without a word. Her 
thoughts were these: 
</p>
<p>
"If they tear me to pieces they shall never 
know through me. He may come,--and then 
just Lord have mercy upon us all: for some 
of us are dead folk to a certainty. But he 
shall do it; not me." 
</p>
<p>
You may fancy, now, her look of determination 
as she faced her master alone in the 
dining-room; Mr. and Mrs. Chadwick having 
left the affair in their nephew's hands, seeing 
that he took it up with such vehemence. 
</p>
<p>
"Norah! Who was that man that came 
to my house last night?" 
</p>
<p>
"Man, sir!" As if infinitely surprised; 
but it was only to gain time. 
</p>
<p>
"Yes; the man whom Mary let in; whom 
she went up-stairs to the nursery to tell you 
about; whom you came down to speak to; 
the same chap, I make no doubt, whom you 
took into the nursery to have your talk out 
with; whom Ailsie saw, and afterwards 
dreamed about; thinking, poor wench! she 
saw him say his prayers, when nothing, I'll 
be bound, was farther from his thoughts; 
who took Mrs. Chadwick's brooch, value ten 
pounds. Now, Norah! Don't go off! I 
am as sure as that my name's Thomas Openshaw, 
that you knew nothing of this robbery. 
But I do think you've been imposed on, and 
that's the truth. Some good-for-nothing 
chap has been making up to you, and you've 
been just like all other women, and have 
turned a soft place in your heart to him; and 
he came last night a-lovyering, and you had 
him up in the nursery, and he made use of 
his opportunities, and made off with a few 
things on his way down! Come, now, 
Norah: it's no blame to you, only you must 
not be such a fool again! Tell us," he 
continued, "what name he gave you, Norah? 
I'll be bound it was not the right one; but it 
will be a clue for the police." 
</p>
<p>
Norah drew herself up. "You may ask 
that question, and taunt me with my being 
single, and with my credulity, as you will, 
Master Openshaw. You'll get no answer 
from me. As for the brooch, and the story 
of theft and burglary; if any friend ever 
came to see me (which I defy you to prove, 
and deny), he'd be just as much above doing 
such a thing as you yourself, Mr. Openshaw 
and more so, too; for I'm not at all sure as 
everything you have is rightly come by, or 
would be yours long, if every man had his 
own." She meant, of course, his wife; but 
he understood her to refer to his property 
in goods and chattels. 
</p>
<p>
"Now, my good woman," said he, "I'll just 
tell you truly, I never trusted you out and 
out; but my wife liked you, and I thought 
you had many a good point about you. If you 
once begin to sauce me, I'll have the police 
to you, and get out the truth in a court of 
justice, if you'll not tell it me quietly and 
civilly here. Now the best thing you can do 
is quietly to tell me who the fellow is. Look 
here! a man comes to my house; asks for 
you; you take him up-stairs, a valuable 
brooch is missing next day; we know that 
you, and Mary, and cook, are honest; but 
you refuse to tell us who the man is. Indeed 
you've told one lie already about him, saying 
no one was here last night. Now I just put 
it to you, what do you think a policeman 
would say to this, or a magistrate? A 
magistrate would soon make you tell the 
truth, my good woman." 
</p>
<p>
"There's never the creature born that 
should get it out of me," said Norah. "Not 
unless I choose to tell." 
</p>
<p>
"I've a great mind to see," said Mr. Openshaw, 
growing angry at the defiance. Then, 
checking himself, he thought before he spoke 
again: 
</p>
<p>
"Norah, for your missus's sake I don't want 
to go to extremities. Be a sensible woman, 
if you can. It's no great disgrace, after all, 
to have been taken in. I ask you once more--
as a friend--who was this man whom you 
let into my house last night?" 
</p>
<p>
No answer. He repeated the question in 
an impatient tone. Still no answer. Norah's 
lips were set in determination not to speak. 
</p>
<p>
"Then there is but one thing to be done. 
I shall send for a policeman." 
</p>
<p>
"You will not," said Norah, starting 
forwards. "You shall not, sir! No policeman 
shall touch me. I know nothing of the 
brooch, but I know this: ever since I was 
four and twenty I have thought more of your 
wife than of myself: ever since I saw her, a 
poor motherless girl put upon in her uncle's 
house, I have thought more of serving her 
than of serving myself! I have cared for 
her and her child, as nobody ever cared for 
me. I don't cast blame on you, sir, but I 
say it's ill giving up one's life to any one; for, 
at the end, they will turn round upon you, 
and forsake you. Why does not my missus 
come herself to suspect me? Maybe she is 
gone for the police? But I don't stay here, 
either for police, or magistrate, or master. 
</p>
<p>
You're an unlucky lot. I believe there's a 
curse on you. I'll leave you this very day. 
Yes! I'll leave that poor Ailsie, too. I will! 
No good will ever come to you!" 
</p>
<p>
Mr. Openshaw was utterly astonished at 
this speech; most of which was completely 
unintelligible to him, as may easily be 
supposed. Before he could make up his mind 
what to say, or what to do, Norah had left 
the room. I do not think he had ever really 
intended to send for the police to this old 
servant of his wife's; for he had never for a 
moment doubted her perfect honesty. But he 
had intended to compel her to tell him who 
the man was, and in this he was baffled. 
He was, consequently, much irritated. He 
returned to his uncle and aunt in a state of 
great annoyance and perplexity, and told 
them he could get nothing out of the woman; 
that some man had been in the house the 
night before; but that she refused to tell who 
he was. At this moment his wife came in, 
greatly agitated, and asked what had 
happened to Norah; for that she had put on her 
things in passionate haste, and had left the 
house. 
</p>
<p>
"This looks suspicious," said Mr. Chadwick. 
"It is not the way in which an 
honest person would have acted." 
</p>
<p>
Mr. Openshaw kept silence. He was sorely 
perplexed. But Mrs. Openshaw turned round 
on Mr . Chadwick with a sudden fierceness 
no one ever saw in her before. 
</p>
<p>
"You don't know Norah, uncle! She is 
gone because she is deeply hurt at being 
suspected. O, I wish I had seen her--that I had 
spoken to her myself. She would have told 
me anything." Alice wrung her hands. 
</p>
<p>
"I must confess," continued Mr. Chadwick 
to his nephew, in a lower voice, "I can't 
make you out. You used to be a word and a 
blow, and oftenest the blow first; and now, 
when there is every cause for suspicion, you 
just do nought. Your missus is a very good 
woman, I grant; but she may have been put 
upon as well as other folk, I suppose. If you 
don't send for the police, I shall." 
</p>
<p>
"Very well," replied Mr. Openshaw, surlily. 
"I can't clear Norah. She won't clear 
herself, as I believe she might if she would. 
Only I wash my hands of it; for I am sure 
the woman herself is honest, and she's lived 
a long time with my wife, and I don't like 
her to come to shame." 
</p>
<p>
"But she will then be forced to clear 
herself. That, at any rate, will be a good thing." 
</p>
<p>
"Very weli, very well! I am heart-sick 
of the whole business. Come, Alice, come 
up to the babies; they'll be in a sore way. 
I tell you, uncle!" he said, turning round 
once more to Mr. Chadwick, suddenly and 
sharply, after his eye had fallen on Alice's 
wan, tearful anxious face; "I'll have none 
sending for the police after all. I'll buy my 
aunt twice as handsome a brooch this very 
day; but I'll not have Norah suspected, and 
my missus plagued. There's for you." 
</p>
<p>
He and his wife left the room. Mr. Chadwick 
quietly waited till lie was out of hearing, 
and then said to his wife; "For all 
Tom's heroics, I'm just quietly going for a 
detective, wench. Thou need'st know nought 
about it." 
</p>
<p>
He went to the police-station, and made a 
statement of the case. He was gratified by 
the impression which the evidence against 
Norah seemed to make. The men all agreed 
in his opinion, and steps were to be 
immediately taken to find out where she was. 
Most probably, as they suggested, she had 
gone at once to the man, who, to all 
appearance, was her lover. When. Mr. Chadwick 
asked how they would find her out? they 
smiled, shook their heads, and spoke of 
mysterious but infallible ways and means. 
He returned to his nephew's house with a 
very comfortable opinion of his own sagacity. 
He was met by his wife with a penitent 
face: 
</p>
<p>
"O master, I've found my brooch! It 
was just sticking by its pin in the flounce of 
my brown silk, that I wore yesterday. I took 
it off in a hurry, and it must have caught in 
it; and I hung up my gown in the closet. 
Just now, when I was going to fold it up, 
there was the brooch! I'm very vexed, but 
I never dreamt but what it was lost!" 
</p>
<p>
Her husband muttering something very 
like "Confound thee and thy brooch too! I 
wish I'd never given it thee," snatched up his 
hat, and rushed back to the station; hoping 
to be in time to stop the police from searching 
for Norah. But a detective was already 
gone off on the errand. 
</p>
<p>
Where was Norah? Half mad with the 
strain of the fearful secret, she had hardly 
slept through the night for thinking what must 
be done. Upon this terrible state of mind had 
come Ailsie's questions, showing that she 
had seen the Man, as the unconscious child 
called her father. Lastly came the suspicion 
of her honesty. She was little less than 
crazy as she ran up-stairs and dashed on her 
bonnet and shawl; leaving all else, even her 
purse, behind her. In that house she would 
not stay. That was all she knew or was clear 
about. She would not even see the children 
again, for fear it should weaken her. She 
feared above everything Mr. Frank's return 
to claim his wife. She could not tell what 
remedy there was for a sorrow so tremendous, 
for her to stay to witness. The 
desire of escaping from the coming event 
was a stronger motive for her departure 
than her soreness about the supicions 
directed against her; although this last 
had been the final goad to the course she 
took. She walked away almost at headlong 
speed; sobbing as she went, as she had not 
dared to do during the past night for fear of 
exciting wonder in those who might hear 
her. Then she stopped. An idea came into 
her mind that she would leave London 
altogether, and betake herself to her native town 
of Liverpool. She felt in her pocket for her 
purse, as she drew near the Euston Square 
station with this intention. She had left 
it at home. Her poor head aching, her 
eyes swollen with crying, she had to stand 
still, and think, as well as she could, where 
next she should bend her steps. Suddenly 
the thought flashed into her mind that she 
would go and find out poor Mr. Frank. She 
had been hardly kind to him the night before, 
though her heart had bled for him ever 
since. She remembered his telling her, as she 
inquired for his address, almost as she had 
pushed him out of the door, of some hotel in 
a street not far distant from Euston Square. 
Thither she went: with what intention she 
hardly knew, but to assuage her conscience 
by telling him how much she pitied him. In 
her present state she felt herself unfit to 
counsel, or restrain, or assist, or do ought else 
but sympathise and weep. The people of the 
inn said such a person had been there; had 
arrived only the day before; had gone out 
soon after his arrival, leaving his luggage 
in their care; but had never come back. 
Norah asked for leave to sit down, and await 
the gentleman's return. The landlady--
pretty secure in the deposit of luggage 
against any probable injury--showed her 
into a room, and quietly locked the door on 
the outside. Norah was utterly worn out, 
and fell asleep a shivering, starting, uneasy 
slumber, which lasted for hours. 
</p>
<p>
The detective, meanwhile, had come up 
with her some time before she entered the 
hotel, into which he followed her. Asking the 
landlady to detain her for an hour or so, without 
giving any reason beyond showing his 
authority (which made the landlady applaud 
herself a good deal for having locked her in), 
he went back to the police-station to report 
his proceedings. He could have taken her 
directly; but his object was, if possible, to 
trace out the man who was supposed to have 
committed the robbery. Then he heard of the 
discovery of the brooch; and consequently 
did not care to return. 
</p>
<p>
Norah slept till even the summer evening 
began to close in. Then up. Some one was 
at the door. It would be Mr. Frank; and 
she dizzily pushed back her ruffled grey hair, 
which had fallen over her eyes, and stood 
looking to see him. Instead, there came in 
Mr. Openshaw and a policeman. 
</p>
<p>
"This is Norah Kennedy," said Mr. Openshaw. 
</p>
<p>
"O, sir," said Norah, "I did not touch the 
brooch; "indeed I did not. O, sir, I cannot 
live to be thought so badly of;" and very 
sick and faint, she suddenly sank down on 
the ground. To her surprise, Mr. Openshaw 
raised her up very tenderly. Even the 
policeman helped to lay her on the sofa; and, 
at Mr. Openshaw's desire, he went for some 
wine and sandwiches; for the poor gaunt 
woman lay there almost as if dead with 
weariness and exhaustion. 
</p>
<p>
"Norah!" said Mr. Openshaw, in his 
kindest voice, "the brooch is found. It was 
hanging to Mrs. Chadwick's gown. I beg 
your pardon. Most truly I beg your pardon, 
for having troubled you about it. My wife is 
almost broken-hearted. Eat, Norah, or, 
stay, first drink this glass of wine," said 
he, lifting her head, pouring a little down 
her throat. 
</p>
<p>
As she drank, she remembered where she 
was, and who she was waiting for. She 
suddenly pushed Mr. Openshaw away, saying, 
"O, sir, you must go. You must not stop 
a minute. If he comes back he will kill 
you." 
</p>
<p>
"Alas, Norah! I do not know who 'he' 
is. But some one is gone away who will never 
come back: some one who knew you, and 
whom I am afraid you cared for." 
</p>
<p>
"I don't understand you, sir," said Norah, 
her master's kind and sorrowful manner 
bewildering her yet more than his words. 
The policeman had left the room at Mr. 
Openshaw's desire, and they two were 
alone. 
</p>
<p>
"You know what I mean, when I say 
some one is gone who will never come back. 
I mean that he is dead!" 
</p>
<p>
"Who?" said Norah, trembling all 
over. 
</p>
<p>
"A poor man has been found in the 
Thames this morning, drowned." 
</p>
<p>
"Did he drown himself?" asked Norah, 
solemnly. 
</p>
<p>
"God only knows," replied Mr. Openshaw, 
in the same tone. "Your name and address 
at our house, were found in his pocket: that, 
and his purse, were the only things, that were 
found upon him. I am sorry to say it, my 
poor Norah; but you are required to go and 
identify him." 
</p>
<p>
"To what? asked Norah. 
</p>
<p>
"To say who it is. It is always done, in 
order that some reason may be discovered 
for the suicide--if suicide it was. I make no 
doubt he was the man who came to see you 
at our house last night. It is very sad, I 
know." He made pauses between each little 
clause, in order to try and bring back her 
senses; which he feared were wandering so 
wild and sad was her look. 
</p>
<p>
"Master Openshaw," said she, at last, 
"I've a dreadful secret to tell you--only you 
must never breathe it to any one, and you 
and I must hide it away for ever. I thought 
to have done it all by myself, but I see I 
cannot. Yon poor man--yes! the dead, 
drowned creature is, I fear, Mr. Frank, my 
mistress's first husband!" 
</p>
<p>
Mr. Openshaw sate down, as if shot. He 
did not speak; but, after a while, he signed 
to Norah to go on. 
</p>
<p>
"He came to me the other night--when--
God be thanked--you were all away at 
Richmond. He asked me if his wife was dead or 
alive. I was a brute, and thought more of 
your all coming home than of his sore trial: 
</p>
<p>
I spoke out sharp, and said she was married 
again, and very content and happy: I all but 
turned him away: and now he lies dead and 
cold!" 
</p>
<p>
"God forgive rne!" said Mr. Openshaw. 
</p>
<p>
"God forgive us all!" said Norah. "Yon 
poor man needs forgiveness perhaps less than 
anyone among us. He had been among the 
savages--shipwrecked--I know not what--
and he had written letters which had never 
reached my poor missus." 
</p>
<p>
"He saw his child!" 
</p>
<p>
"He saw her--yes! I took him up, to 
give his thoughts another start; for I 
believed he was going mad on my hands. I 
came to seek him here, as I more than 
half-promised. My mind misgave me when I 
heard he had never come in. O, sir! it must 
be him!" 
</p>
<p>
Mr. Openshaw rang the bell. Norah was 
almost too much stunned to wonder at what 
he did. He asked for writing materials, 
wrote a letter, and then said to Norah: 
</p>
<p>
"I am writing to Alice, to say I shall be 
unavoidably absent for a few days; that I 
have found you; that you are well, and send 
her your love, and will come home to-morrow. 
You must go with me to the Police 
Court; you must identify the body: I will 
pay high to keep names and details out of 
the papers. 
</p>
<p>
"But where are you going, sir?" 
</p>
<p>
He did not answer her directly. Then he 
said: 
</p>
<p>
"Norah! I must go with you, and look on 
the face of the man whom I have so injured, 
unwittingly, it is true; but it seems to me 
as if I had killed him. I will lay his head in 
the grave, as if he were my only brother: 
and how he must have hated me! I cannot 
go home to my wife till all that I can do 
for him is done. Then I go with a dreadful 
secret on my mind. I shall never speak of it 
again, after these days are over. I know you 
will not, either." He shook hands with her: 
and they never named the subject again, the 
one to the other. 
</p>
<p>
Norah went home to Alice the next day. 
Not a word was said on the cause of her 
abrupt departure a day or two before. Alice 
had been charged by her husband in his 
letter not to allude to the supposed theft of 
the broach; so she, implicitly obedient to 
those whom she loved both by nature and 
habit, was entirely silent on the subject, only 
treated Norah with the most tender respect, 
as if to make up for unjust suspicion. 
</p>
<p>
Nor did Alice inquire into the reason why 
Mr. Openshaw had been absent during his 
uncle and aunt's visit, after he had once said 
that it was unavoideble. He came back, 
grave and quiet; and, from that time forth 
was curiously changed. More thoughtful, 
and perhaps less active; quite as decided 
in conduct, but with new and different rules 
for the guidance of that conduct. Towards 
Alice he could hardly be more kind than he 
had always been; but he now seemed to look 
upon her as some one sacred and to be 
treated with reverence, as well as tenderness. 
He throve in business, and made a large 
fortune, one half of which was settled upon 
her. 
</p>
<break/>
<p>
Long years after these events,--a few 
months after her mother died, Ailsie and her 
"father" (as she always called Mr. Openshaw), 
drove to a cemetery a little way out 
of town, and she was carried to a certain 
mound by her maid, who was then sent back 
to the carriage. There was a head-stone, 
with F. W. and a date. That was all. Sitting 
by the grave, Mr. Openshaw told her the 
story; and for the sad fate of that poor 
father whom she had never seen, he shed the 
only tears she ever saw fall from his eyes. 
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
"A most interesting story, all through," I 
said, as Jarber folded up the first of his 
series of discoveries in triumph. "A story 
that goes straight to the heart--especially 
at the end. But "--I stopped, and looked 
at Trottle. 
</p>
<p>
Trottle entered his protest directly in the 
shape of a cough. 
</p>
<p>
"Well!" I said, beginning to lose my 
patience. "Don't you see that I want you 
to speak, and that I don't want you to 
cough?" 
</p>
<p>
"Quite so, ma'am," said Trottle, in a state 
of respectful obstinacy which would have 
upset the temper of a saint. "Relative, I 
presume, to this story, ma'am?" 
</p>
<p>
"Yes, yes!" said Jarber. "By all means 
let us hear what this good man has to 
say." 
</p>
<p>
"Well, sir," answered Trottle, "I want to 
know why the House over the way doesn't 
let, and I don't exactly see how your story 
answers the question. That's all I have to 
say, sir." 
</p>
<p>
I should have liked to contradict my 
opinionated servant, at that moment. But, 
excelent as the story was in itself, I felt 
that he had hit on the weak point, so far as 
Jarber's particular purpose in reading it was 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>
And that is what you have to say, is it?" 
repeated Jarber. "I enter this room 
announcing that I have a series of discoveries, 
and you jump instantly to the conclusion that 
the first of the series exhausts my resources. 
Have I your permission, dear lady, to enlighten 
this obtuse person, if possible, by 
reading Number Two?" 
</p>
<p>
"My work is behindhand, ma'am," said 
Trottle, moving to the door, the moment I 
gave Jarber leave to go on. 
</p>
<p>
"Stop where you are," I said, in my most 
peremptory manner, "and give Mr. Jarber 
his fair opportunity of answering your 
objection now you have made it." 
</p>
<p>
Trottle sat down with the look of a martyr, 
and Jarber began to read with his back 
turned on the enemy more decidedly than 
ever. 
</p>

<chapter>
<title>Going Into Society.</title>
<p>
AT one period of its reverses, the House 
fell into the occupation of a Showman. 
He was found registered as its occupier, 
on the parish books of the time when he 
rented the House, and there was therefore 
no need of any clue to his name. But, he 
himself was less easy to be found; for, he 
had led a wandering life, and settled people 
had lost sight of him, and people who plumed 
themselves on being respectable were shy of 
admitting that they had ever known 
anything of him. At last, among the marsh 
lands near the river's level, that lie about 
Deptford and the neighbouring market-gardens, 
a Grizzled Personage in velveteen, with 
a face so cut up by varieties of weather that 
he looked as if he had been tattoo'd, was 
found smoking a pipe at the door of a wooden 
house on wheels. The wooden house was laid 
up in ordinary for the winter near the mouth 
of a muddy creek; and everything near it, 
the foggy river, the misty marshes, and the 
steaming market-gardens, smoked in 
company with the grizzled man. In the midst 
of this smoking party, the funnel-chimney of 
the wooden house on wheels was not remiss, 
but took its pipe with the rest in a 
companionable manner. 
</p>
<p>
On being asked if it were he who had once 
rented the House to Let, Grizzled Velveteen 
looked surprised, and said yes. Then his 
name was Magsman? That was it, Toby 
Magsman--which lawfully christened Robert; 
but called in the line, from a infant, Toby. 
There was nothing agin Toby Magsman, he 
believed? If there was suspicion of such 
mention it! 
</p>
<p>
There was no suspicion of such, he might 
rest assured. But, some inquiries were making 
about that House, and would he object to say 
why he left it? 
</p>
<p>
Not at all; why should he? He left it, 
along of a Dwarf. 
</p>
<p>
Along of a Dwarf? 
</p>
<p>
Mr. Magsman repeated, deliberately and 
emphatically, Along of a Dwarf. 
</p>
<p>
Might it be compatible with Mr. 
Magsman's inclination and convenience, to enter, 
as a favour, into a few particulars? 
</p>
<p>
Mr. Magsman entered into the following 
particulars. 
</p>
<p>
It was a long time ago, to begin with;--
afore lotteries and a deal more, was done 
away with. Mr. Magsman was looking about 
for a good pitch, and he see that house, and 
he says to himselt, "I'll have you, it you're 
to be had. If money'll get you, I'll have 
you." 
</p>
<p>
The neighbours cut up rough, and made 
complaints; but Mr. Magsman don't know 
what they would have had. It was a lovely 
thing. First of all, there was the canvass, 
representin the picter of the Giant, in 
Spanish trunks and a ruff, who was himself 
half the heighth of the house, and was run up 
with a line and pulley to a pole on the roof, 
so that his Ed was coeval with the parapet. 
Then, there was the canvass, representin 
the picter of the Albina lady, showin her 
white air to the Army and Navy in correct 
uniform. Then, there was the canvass, 
representin the picter of the Wild Indian a 
scalpin a member of some foreign nation. 
Then, there was the canvass, representin the 
picter of a child of a British Planter, seized 
by two Boa Constrictors--not that we never 
had no child, nor no Constrictors neither. 
Similiarly, there was the canvass, representin 
the picter of the Wild Ass of the Prairies--
not that we never had no wild asses, nor 
wouldn't have had 'em at a gift. Last, there 
was the canvass, representin the picter of 
the Dwarf, and like him too (considerin), 
with George the Fourth in such a state of 
astonishment at him as His Majesty couldn't 
with his utmost politeness and stoutness 
express. The front of the House was so 
covered with canvasses, that there wasn't a 
spark of daylight ever visible on that side. 
"MAGSMAN'S AMUSEMENTS," fifteen foot long 
by two foot high, ran over the front door 
and parlor winders. The passage was a 
Arbour of green baize and gardenstuff. A 
barrel-organ performed there unceasing. And 
as to respectability,--if threepence ain't 
respectable, what is? 
</p>
<p>
But, the Dwarf is the principal article at 
present, and he was worth the money. He 
was wrote up as MAJOR TPSCHOFFKI, OF THE 
IMPERIAL BULGRADERIAN BRIGADE. Nobody 
couldn't pronounce the name, and it never 
was intended anybody should. The public 
always turned it, as a regular rule, into 
Chopski. In the line he was called Chops; 
partly on that account, and partly because 
his real name, if he ever had any real name 
(which was very dubious), was Stakes. 
</p>
<p>
He was a un-common small man, he really 
was. Certainly, not so small as he was made 
out to be, but where is your Dwarf as is? 
He was a most uncommon small man with a 
most uncommon large Ed; and what he had 
inside that Ed, nobody never knowed but 
himself: even supposin himself to have ever 
took stock of it, which it would have been a 
stiff job for even him to do. 
</p>
<p>
The kindest little man as never growed! 
Spirited, but not proud. When he travelled 
with the Spotted Baby--though he knowed 
himself to be a nat'ral Dwarf, and knowed 
the Baby's spots to be put upon him 
artificial, he nursed that Baby like a mother. 
You never heerd him give a ill-name to a 
Giant. He did allow himself to break out 
into strong language respectin the Fat Lady 
from Norfolk; but that was an affair of the 
'art; and when a man's 'art has been trifled 
with by a lady, and the preference giv to a 
Indian, he ain't master of his actions. 
</p>
<p>
He was always in love, of course; every 
human nat'ral phenomenon is. And he was 
always in love with a large woman; I never 
knowed the Dwarf as could be got to love a 
small one. Which helps to keep 'em the 
Curiosities they are. 
</p>
<p>
One sing'ler idea he had in that Ed of his, 
which must have meant something, or il 
wouldn't have been there. It was always his 
opinion that he was entitled to property. 
He never would put his name to anything. 
He had been taught to write, by the young 
man without arms, who got his living 
with his toes (quite a writing-master he 
was, and taught scores in the line), but 
Chops would have starved to death, afore 
he'd have gained a bit of bread by putting 
his hand to a paper. This is the more curious 
to bear in mind, because HE had no property, 
nor hope of property, except his house and a 
sarser. When I say his house, I mean the 
box, painted and got up outside like a reg'lar 
six-roomer, that he used to creep into, with a 
diamond ring (or quite as good to look at) on 
his forefinger, and ring a little bell out of 
what the Public believed to be the Drawing-room 
winder. And when I say a sarser, I 
mean a Chancy sarser in which he made a 
collection for himself at the end of every 
Entertainment. His cue for that, he took 
from me: "Ladies and gentlemen, the little 
man will now walk three times round the 
Cairawan, and retire behind the curtain." 
When he said anything important, in private 
life, he mostly wound it up with this form of 
words, and they was generally the last thing 
he said to me at night afore he went to bed. 
</p>
<p>
He had what I consider a fine mind--a 
poetic mind. His ideas respectin his 
property, never come upon him so strong as 
when he sat upon a barrel-organ and had the 
handle turned. Arter the wibration had 
run through him a little time, he would 
screech out, "Toby, I feel my property 
coming--grind away! I'm counting my 
guineas by thousands, Toby--grind away! 
Toby, I shall be a man of fortun! I feel 
the Mint a jingling in me, Toby, and I'm 
swelling out into the Bank of England!" 
Such is the influence of music on a poetic 
mind. Not that he was partial to any other 
music but a barrel-organ; on the contrairy, 
hated it. 
</p>
<p>
He had a kind of a everlasting grudge 
agin the Public: which is a thing you may 
notice in many phenomenons that get their 
living out of it. What riled him most in the 
nater of his occupation was, that it kep him 
out of Society. He was continiwally sayin, 
"Toby, my ambition is, to go into Society. 
The curse of my position towards the Public, 
is, that it keeps me hout of Society. This 
don't signify to a low beast of a Indian; he 
an't formed for Society. This don't signify 
to a Spotted Baby; he an't formed for 
Society. I am." 
</p>
<p>
Nobody never could make out what Chops 
done with his money. He had a good salary, 
down on the drum every Saturday as the day 
come round, besides having the run of his 
teeth--and he was a Woodpecker to eat--but 
all Dwarfs are. The sarser was a little 
income, bringing him in so many halfpence 
that he'd carry 'em, for a week together, tied 
up in a pocket handkercher. And yet he 
never had money. And it couldn't be the 
Fat Lady from Norfolk, as was once 
supposed; because it stands to reason that when 
you have a animosity towards a Indian which 
makes you grind your teeth at him to his face, 
and which can hardly hold you from Goosing 
him audible when he's going through his 
War-Dance--it stands to reason you wouldn't 
under them circumstances deprive yourself, 
to support that Indian in the lap of luxury. 
</p>
<p>
Most unexpected, the mystery come out 
one day at Eghirm Eaces. The Public was 
shy of bein pulled in, and Chops was riugin 
his little bell out of his drawing-room winder, 
and was snarlin to me over his shoulder as 
he kneeled down with his legs out at the 
back-door--for he couldn't be shoved into 
his house without kneeling down, and the 
premises wouldn't accommodate his legs--
was snarlin, "Here's a precious Public for 
you; why the Devil don't they tumble up?" 
when a man in the crowd holds up a 
carrier-pigeon, and cries out, "If there's any person 
here as has got a ticket, the Lottery's just 
drawed, and the number as has come up for 
the great prize is three, seven, forty-two! 
Three, seven, forty-two!" I was givin the 
man to the Furies myself, for calling off the 
Public's attention--for the Public will turn 
away, at any time, to look at anything in 
preference to the thing showed 'em; and if you 
doubt it, get 'em together for any indiwidual 
purpose on the face of the earth, and send only 
two people in late, and see if the whole company 
an't far more interested in takin particular 
notice of them two than of you--I say, I 
wasn't best pleased with the man for callin 
out, and, wasn't blessin him in my own mind, 
when I see Chops's little bell fly out of 
winder at a old lady, and he gets up and 
kicks his box over, exposin the whole secret, 
and he catches hold of the calves of my legs 
and he says to me, "Carry me into the wan, 
Toby, and throw a pail of water over me or 
I'm a dead man, for I've come into my 
property!" 
</p>
<p>
Twelve thousand odd hundred pound, was 
Chops's winnins. He had bought a 
half-ticket for the twenty-five thousand prize, and 
it had come up. The first use he made of 
his property, was, to offer to fight the Wild 
Indian for five hundred pound a side, him 
with a poisoned darnin-needle and the Indian 
with a club; but the Indian bein in want of 
backers to that amount, it went no further. 
</p>
<p>
Arter he had been mad for a week--in a 
state of mind, in short, in which, if I had let 
him sit on the organ for only two minutes, 
I believe he would have bust--but we kep 
the organ from him--Mr. Chops come round, 
and behaved liberal and beautiful to all. He 
then sent for a young man he knowed, as had 
a wery genteel appearance and was a Bonnet 
at a gaming-booth (most respectable brought 
up, father havin been imminent in the livery 
stable line but unfort'nate in a commercial 
crisis through paintin a old grey, ginger-bay, 
and sellin him with a Pedigree), and Mr. 
Chops said to this Bonnet, who said his name 
was Normandy, which it wasn't: 
</p>
<p>
"Normandy, I'm a goin into Society. Will 
you go with me?" 
</p>
<p>
Saya Normandy: "Do I understand you, 
Mr. Chops, to hintimate that the 'ole of the 
expenses of that move will be borne by yourself?" 
</p>
<p>
"Correct," says Mr. Chops. "And you 
shall have a Princely allowance too." 
</p>
<p>
The Bonnet lifted Mr. Chops upon a chair, 
to shake hands with him, and replied in 
poetry, with his eyes seeminly fall of tears: 
"My boat is on the shore, 
And my bark is on the sea, 
And I do not ask for more, 
But I'll Go;--along with thee." 
They went into Society, in a chay and four 
greys with silk jackets. They took lodgings 
in Pall Mall, London, and they blazed away. 
</p>
<p>
In consequence of a note that was brought 
to Bartlemy Fair in the autumn of next year 
by a servant, most wonderful got up in 
milk-white cords and tops, I cleaned myself and 
went to Pall Mall, one evenin appinted. The 
gentlemen was at their wine arter dinner, 
and Mr. Chops's eyes was more fixed in that 
Ed of his than I thought good for him. There 
was three of 'em (in company, I mean), and I 
knowed the third well. When last met, he 
had on a white Roman shirt, and a bishop's-mitre 
covered with leopard-skin, and played 
the clarionet all wrong, in a band at a Wild 
Beast Show. 
</p>
<p>
This gent took on not to know me, and Mr. 
Chops said: "Gentlemen, this is a old friend 
of former days:" and Normandy looked at 
me through a eye-glass, and said, "Magsman, 
glad to see you!"--which I'll take my oath 
he wasn't. Mr. Chops, to git him convenient 
to the table, had his chair on a throne (much 
of the form of George the Fourth's in the 
canvass), but he hardly appeared to me to be 
King there in any other pint of view, for 
his two gentlemen ordered about like 
Emperors. They was all dressed like May-Day--
gorgeous!--and as to Wine, they 'swam 
in all sorts. 
</p>
<p>
I made the round of the bottles, first separate 
(to say I had done it), and then mixed 
'em all together (to say I had done it), and 
then tried two of 'em as half-and-half, and 
then t'other two. Altogether, I passed a 
pleasin evenin, but with a tendency to feel 
muddled, until I considered it good manners 
to get up and say, "Mr. Chops, the best of 
friends must part, I thank you for the 
wariety of foreign drains you have stood so 
'ansome, I looks towards you in red wine, and 
I takes my leave." Mr. Chops replied, "If 
you'll just hitch me out of this over your 
right arm, Magsman, and carry me 
downstairs, I'll see you out." I said I couldn't 
think of such a thing, but he would have it, 
so I lifted him off his throne. He smelt 
strong of Maideary, and I couldn't help thinking 
as I carried him down that it was like 
carrying a large bottle full of wine, with a 
rayther ugly stopper, a good deal out of 
proportion. 
</p>
<p>
When I set him on the door-mat in the 
hall, he kep me close to him by holding on to 
my coat-collar, and he whispers: 
"I an't 'appy, Magsman." 
"What's on your mind, Mr. Chops?" 
"They don't use me well. They an't 
grateful to me. They puts me on the mantelpiece 
when I won't have in more Champagne-wine, 
and they locks me in the sideboard 
when I won't give up my property." 
"Get rid of 'em, Mr. Chops." 
"I can't. We're in Society together, and 
what would Society say?" 
</p>
<p>
"Come out of Society," says I. 
</p>
<p>
"I can't. You don't know what you're 
talking about. When you have once gone 
into Society, you mustn't come out of it." 
</p>
<p>
"Then if you'll excuse the freedom, Mr. 
Chops," were my remark, shaking my head 
grave, "I think it's a pity you ever went in." 
</p>
<p>
Mr. Chops shook that deep Ed of his, to 
a surprisin extent, and slapped it half a 
dozen times with his hand, and with more 
Wice than I thought were in him. Then, 
he says, "You're a good feller, but you don't 
understand. Good night, go along. Magsman, 
the little man will now walk three 
times round the Cairawan, and retire behind 
the curtain." The last I see of him on that 
occasion was his tryin, on the extremest 
werge of insensibility, to climb up the stairs, 
one by one, with his hands and knees. They'd 
have been much too steep for him, if he had 
been sober; but he wouldn't be helped. 
</p>
<p>
It warn't long after that, that I read in the 
newspaper of Mr. Chops's being presented at 
court. It was printed, "It will be recollected"--
and I've noticed in my life, that it 
is sure to be printed that it will be 
recollected, whenever it won't--"that Mr. Chops 
is the individual of small stature, whose 
brilliant success in the last State Lottery 
attracted so much attention." Well, I says to 
myself, Such is life! He has been and done 
it in earnest at last! He has astonished 
George the Fourth! 
</p>
<p>
(On account of which, I had that canvass 
new-painted, him with a bag of money in 
his hand, a presentin it to George the 
Fourth, and a lady in Ostrich Feathers fallin 
in love with him in a bag-wig, sword, and 
buckles correct.) 
</p>
<p>
I took the House as is the subject of present 
inquiries though not the honor of bein 
acquainted--and I run, Magsman's Amusements 
in it thirteen months--sometimes one 
thing, sometimes another, sometimes nothin 
particular, but alwaysall the canvasses outside. 
One night, when we had played the last 
company out, which was a shy company through 
its raining Heavens hard, I was takin a 
pipe in the one pair back along with the young 
man with the toes, which I had taken on for 
a month (though he never drawed--except 
on paper), and I heard a kickin at the 
street door. "Halloa!" I says to the young 
man, "what's up!" He rubs his eyebrows 
with his toes, and he says, "I can't imagine, 
Mr. Magsman" which he never could 
imagine nothin, and was monotonous 
company. 
</p>
<p>
The noise not leavin off, I laid down my 
pipe, and I took up a candle, and I went down 
and opened the door. I looked out into the 
street; but nothin could I see, and nothin 
was I aware of, until I turned round 
quick, because some creetur run between 
my legs into the passage. There was Mr. 
Chops! 
</p>
<p>
"Magsman," he says, "take me, on the 
hold terms, and you've got me; if it's done, 
say done!" 
</p>
<p>
I was all of a maze, but I said, "Done, 
sir." 
</p>
<p>
"Done to your done, and double done!" 
says he. "Have you got a bit of supper in 
the house?" 
</p>
<p>
Bearin in mind them sparklin warieties 
of foreign drains as we'd guzzled away at in 
Pall Mall, I was ashamed to offer him cold 
sassages and gin-and-water; but he took 'em 
both and took 'em free; havin a chair for his 
table, and sittin down at it on a stool, 
like hold times. I, all of a maze all the 
while. 
</p>
<p>
It was arter he had made a clean sweep of 
the sassages (beef, and to the best of my 
calculations two pound and a quarter), that the 
wisdom as was in that little man, began to 
come out of him like prespiration. 
</p>
<p>
"Magsman," he says, "look upon me! You 
see afore you, One as has both gone into 
Society and come out." 
</p>
<p>
"Oh! You are out of it, Mr. Chops? How 
did you get out, sir?" 
</p>
<p>
"SOLD OUT!" says he. You never saw the 
like of the wisdom as his Ed expressed, when 
he made use of them two words. 
</p>
<p>
"My friend Magsman, I'll impart to you 
a discovery I've made. It's wallable; it's 
cost twelve thousand five hundred pound; it 
may do you good in life.--The secret of 
this matter is, that it ain't so much that a 
person goes into Society, as that Society goes 
into a person." 
</p>
<p>
Not exactly keeping up with his meanin, 
I shook my head, put on a deep look, and 
said, "You're right there, Mr. Chops." 
</p>
<p>
"Magsman," he says, twitchin me by the. 
leg, "Society has gone into me, to the tune of 
every penny of my property." 
</p>
<p>
I felt that I went pale, and though natrally 
a bold speaker, I couldn't hardly say, 
"Where's Normandy?" 
</p>
<p>
"Bolted. With the plate," said Mr. 
Chops. 
</p>
<p>
"And t'other one? "--meaning him as 
formerly wore the bishop's mitre. 
</p>
<p>
"Bolted. With the jewels," said Mr. 
Chops. 
</p>
<p>
I sat down and looked at him, and he stood 
up and looked at me. 
</p>
<p>
"Magsman," he says, and he seemed to 
myself to get wiser as he got hoarser; 
"Society, taken in the lump, is all dwarfs. At the 
court of Saint James's, they was alia doin my 
hold bisness--all a goin three times round the 
Cairawan, in the hold Court-suits and properties. 
Elsewheres, they was most of 'em ringin 
their little bells out of make-believes. 
Everywheres, the sarser was a goin round, 
Magsman, the sarser is the uniwersal Institution!" 
</p>
<p>
I perceived, you understand, that he was 
soured by his misfortuns, and I felt for Mr. 
Chops. 
</p>
<p>
"As to Fat Ladies," says he, giving his Ed 
a tremendious one agin the wall, "there's lots 
of them in Society, and worse than the original. 
Hers was a outrage upon Taste--simply a 
outrage upon Taste--awakenin contempt--
carryin its own punishment in the form of 
a Indian!" Here he giv himself another 
tremendious one. "But theirs, Magsman, 
theirs is mercenary outrages. Lay in Cashmeer 
shawls, buy bracelets, strew 'em and a lot of 
'andsome fans and things about your rooms, 
let it be known that you give away like 
water to all as come to admire, and the 
Fat Ladies that don't exhibit for so much 
down upon the drum, will come from all the 
pints of the compass to flock about you, 
whatever you are. They'll drill holes in 
your 'art, Magsman, like a Cullender. And 
when you've no more left to give, they'll 
laugh at you to your face, and leave you to 
have your bones picked dry by Wulturs, like 
the dead Wild Ass of the Prairies that you 
deserve to be!" Here he giv himself the 
most tremendious one of all, and dropped. 
</p>
<p>
I thought he was gone. His Ed was so 
heavy, and he knocked it so hard, and he 
fell so stoney, and the sassagerial disturbance 
in him must have been so immense, that I 
thought he was gone. But, he soon come 
round with care, and he sat up on the floor, 
and he said to me, with wisdom comin out 
of his eyes, if ever it come: 
</p>
<p>
"Magsman! The most material difference 
between the two states of existence through 
which your unappy friend has passed;" he 
reached out his poor little hand, and his 
tears dropped down on the moustachio which 
it was a credit to him to have done his best 
to grow, but it is not in mortals to command 
success, '--the difference is this. When 
I was out of Society, I was paid light for 
being seen. When I went into Society, I 
paid heavy for being seen. I prefer the 
former, even if I wasn't forced upon it. Give 
me out through the trumpet, in the hold way, 
tomorrow." 
</p>
<p>
Arter that, he slid into the line again as 
easy as if he had been iled all over. But, the 
organ was kep from him, and no allusions 
was ever made, when a company was in, to 
his property. He got wiser every day; his 
views of Society and the Public was luminous, 
bewilderin, awful; and his Ed got 
bigger and bigger as his Wisdom 
expanded it. 
</p>
<p>
He took well, and pulled 'em in most 
excellent fur nine weeks. At the expiration of 
that period, when his Ed was a sight, he 
expressed one evenin, the last Company havin 
been turned out, and the door shut, a wish to 
have a little music. 
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Chops," I said (I never dropped the 
"Mr." with Idiu; the world might do it, but 
not me); "Mr. Chops, are you sure as you 
are in a state of mind and body to sit upon 
the organ?" 
</p>
<p>
His answer was this: "Toby, when next 
met with on the tramp, I forgive her and the 
Indian. And I am." 
</p>
<p>
It was with fear and trembling that I began 
to turn the handle; but he sat like a lamb. 
It will be my belief to my dying day, that I 
see his Ed expand as he sat; you may therefore 
judge how great his thoughts was. He 
sat out all the changes, and then he come off. 
</p>
<p>
"Toby," he says, with a quiet smile, "the 
little man will now walk three times round 
the Cairawan, and retire behind the curtain." 
</p>
<p>
When we called him in the morning, we 
found him gone into a much better Society 
than mine or Pall Mall's. I giv Mr. Chops 
as comfortable a funeral as lay in my power, 
followed myself as Chief, and had the George 
the Fourth canvass carried first, in the form 
of a banner. But, the House was so dismal 
arterwards, that I giv it up, and took to the 
Wan again. 
</p>
<p>
--
</p>
<p>
"I don't triumph," said Jarber, folding up 
the second manuscript, and looking hard at 
Trottle. "I don't triumph over this worthy 
creature. I merely ask him if he is 
satisfied now?" 
</p>
<p>
"How can he be anything else?" I said, 
answering for Trottle, who sat obstinately 
silent. "This time, Jarber, you have not 
only read us a delightfully amusing story, 
but you have also answered the question 
about the House. Of course it stands empty 
now. Who would think of taking it after 
it had been turned into a caravan?" I 
looked at Trottle, as I said those last words, 
and Jarber waved his hand indulgently in 
the same direction. 
</p>
<p>
"Let this excellent person speak," said 
Jarber. "You were about to say, my good 
man?"--
</p>
<p>
"I only wished to ask, sir," said Trottle, 
i doggedly, "if you could kindly oblige me with 
a date or two, in connection with that last 
story?" 
</p>
<p>
"A date!" repeated Jarber. "What does 
the man want with dates!" 
</p>
<p>
"I should be glad to know, with great 
respect," persisted Trottle, "if the person 
named Magsman was the last tenant who 
lived in the House. It's my opinion--if 
I may be excused for giving it--that he most 
decidedly was not." 
</p>
<p>
With those words, Trottle made a low 
bow, and quietly left the room. 
</p>
<p>
There is no denying that Jarber, when 
we were left together, looked sadly discomposed. 
He had evidently forgotten to 
inquire about dates; and, in spite of his 
magnificent talk about his series of 
discoveries, it was quite as plain that the two 
stories he had just read, had really and truly 
exhausted his present stock. I thought 
myself bound, in common gratitude, to help 
him out of his embarrassment by a timely 
suggestion. So I proposed that he should 
come to tea again, on the next Monday 
evening, the thirteenth, and should make 
such inquiries in the meantime, as might 
enable him to dispose triumphantly of 
Trottle's objection. 
</p>
<p>
He gallantly kissed my hand, made a neat 
little speech of acknowledgment, and took 
his leave. For the rest of the week I would 
not encourage Trottle by allowing him to 
refer to the House at all. I suspected he 
was making his own inquiries about dates, 
but I put no questions to him. 
</p>
<p>
On Monday evening, the thirteenth, that 
dear unfortunate Jarber came, punctual to 
the appointed time. He looked so terribly 
harassed, that he was really quite a spectacle 
of feebleness and fatigue. I saw, at a glance, 
that the question of dates had gone against 
him, that Mr. Magsman had not been the 
last tenant of the House, and that the reason 
of its emptiness was still to seek. 
</p>
<p>
"What I have gone through," said Jarber, 
"words arc not eloquent enough to tell. Oh, 
Sophonisba, I have begun another series of 
discoveries! Accept the last two as stories 
laid on your shrine; and wait to blame me 
for leaving your curiosity uuappeased, until 
you have heard Number Three." 
</p>
<p>
Number Three looked like a very short 
manuscript, and I said as much. Jarber 
explained to me that we were to have 
some poetry this time. In the course of his 
investigations he had stepped into the Circulating 
Library, to seek for information on the 
one important subject. All the Library-people 
knew about the House was, that a 
female relative of the last tenant as they 
believed, had, just after that tenant left, 
sent a little manuscript poem to them which 
she described as referring to events that had 
actually passed in the House; and which she 
wanted the proprietor of the Library to publish. 
She had written no address on her letter; 
and the proprietor had kept the manuscript 
ready to be given back to her (the publishing 
of poems not being in his line) when she might 
call for it. She had never called for it; 
and the poem had been lent to Jarber, at his 
express request, to read to rne. 
</p>
<p>
Before he began, I rang the bell for Trottle; 
being determined to have him present at the 
new reading, as a wholesome check on his 
obstinacy. To my surprise Peggy answered 
the bell, and told me that Trottle had stepped 
out, without saying where. I instantly felt 
the strongest possible conviction that he 
was at his old tricks: and that his stepping 
out in the evening, without leave, meant 
Philandering. 
</p>
<p>
Controlling myself on my visitor's account, 
I dismissed Peggy, stifled my indignation, 
and prepared, as politely as might be, to 
listen to Jarber.

<hr/>
<p>
I could warmly and sincerely praise the 
little poem, when Jarber had done reading 
it; but I could not say that it tended in any 
degree towards clearing up the mystery of 
the empty House. 
</p>
<p>
Whether it was the absence of the 
irritating influence of Trottle, or whether it was 
simply fatigue, I cannot say, but Jarber did 
not strike me, that evening, as being in his 
usual spirits. And though he declared that 
he was not in the least daunted by his want 
of success thus far, and that he was resolutely 
determined to make more discoveries, he 
spoke in a languid absent manner, and shortly 
afterwards took his leave at rather an early 
hour. 
</p>
<p>
When Trottle came back, and when I 
indignantly taxed him with Philandering, he 
not only denied the imputation, but asserted 
that he had been employed on my service, 
and, in consideration of that, boldly asked 
for leave of absence for two days, and for a 
morning to himself afterwards, to complete 
the business, in which he solemnly declared 
that I was interested. In remembrance of 
his long and faithful service to me, I did 
violence to myself, and granted his request. 
And he, on his side, engaged to explain 
himself to my satisfaction, in a week's time, on 
Monday evening the twentieth. 
</p>
<p>
A day or two before, I sent to Jarber's 
lodgings to ask him to drop in to tea. His 
landlady sent back an apology for him that 
made my hair stand on end. His feet were 
in hot water; his head was in a flannel 
petticoat; a green shade was over his eyes; the 
rheumatism was in his legs; and a mustard-poultice 
was on his chest. He was also a 
little feverish, and rather distracted in his 
mind about Manchester Marriages, a Dwarf, 
and Three Evenings, or Evening Parties--his 
landlady was not sure which--in an empty 
House, with the Water Rate unpaid. 
</p>
<p>
Under these distressing circumstances, I 
was necessarily left alone with Trottle. His 
promised explanation began, like Jarber's 
discoveries, with the reading of a written 
paper. The only difference was that Trottle 
introduced his manuscript under the name of 
a Report. 
</p>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Trottle's Report.</title>
<p>
THE curious events related in these pages 
would, many of them, most likely never have 
happened, if a person named Trottle had not 
presumed, contrary to his usual custom, to 
think for himself. 
</p>
<p>
The subject on which the person in question 
had ventured, for the first time in his life, 
to form an opinion purely and entirely his 
own, was one which had already excited 
the interest of his respected mistress in 
a very extraordinary degree. Or, to put it 
in plainer terms still, the subject was no 
other than the mysteiry of the empty House. 
</p>
<p>
Feeling no sort of objection to set a 
success of his own, if possible, side by 
side, with a failure of Mr. Jarber's, Trottle 
made up his mind, one Monday evening, 
to try what he could do, on his own account, 
towards clearing up the mystery of the 
empty House. Carefully dismissing from 
his mind all nonsensical notions of former 
tenants and their histories, and keeping the 
one point in view steadily before him, he 
started to reach it in the shortest way, by 
walking straight up to the House, and bringing 
himself face to face with the first person 
in it who opened the door to him. 
</p>
<p>
It was getting towards dark, on Monday 
evening, the thirteenth of the month, when 
Trottle first set foot on the steps of the House. 
When he knocked at the door, he knew 
nothing of the matter which he was about 
to investigate, except that the landlord was 
an elderly widower of good fortune, and that 
his name was Forley. A small beginning 
enough for a man to start from, certainly! 
</p>
<p>
On dropping the knocker, his first 
proceeding was to look down cautiously out of 
the corner of his right eye, for any results 
which might show themselves at the 
kitchen-window. There appeared at it 
immediately the figure of a woman, who looked 
up inquisitively at the stranger on the steps, 
left the window in a hurry, and came back to 
it with an open letter in her hand, which she 
held up to the fading light. After looking 
over the letter hastily for a moment or so, 
the woman disappeared once more. 
</p>
<p>
Trottle next heard footsteps shuffling and 
scraping along the bare hall of the house. On 
a sudden they ceased, and the sound of two 
voices--a shrill persuading voice and a gruff 
resisting voice--confusedly reached his ears. 
After a while, the voices left off speaking--
a chain was undone, a bolt drawn back--
the door opened--and Trottle stood face to 
face with two persons, a woman in advance, 
and a man behind her, leaning back flat 
against the wall. 
</p>
<p>
"Wish you good evening, sir," says the 
woman, in such a sudden way, and in such a 
cracked voice, that it was quite startling to 
hear her. "Chilly weather, ain't it, sir? 
Please to walk in. You come from good 
Mr. Forley, don't you, sir?" 
</p>
<p>
"Don't you, sir?" chimes in the man 
hoarsely, making a sort of gruff echo of 
himself, and chuckling after it, as if he 
thought he had made a joke. 
</p>
<p>
If Trottle had said, "No," the door 
would have been probably closed in his 
face. Therefore, he took circumstances as he 
found them, and boldly ran all the risk, whatever 
it might be, of saying, "Yes." 
</p>
<p>
"Quite right, sir," says the woman. "Good 
Mr. Forley's letter told us his particular 
friend would be here to represent him, at 
dusk, on Monday the thirteenth or, if not 
on Monday the thirteenth, then on Monday 
the twentieth, at the same time, without 
fail. And here you are on the Monday the 
thirteenth, ain't you, sir? Mr. Forley's 
particular friend, and dressed all in black--quite 
right, sir! Please to step into the dining-room--
it's always kep scoured and clean 
against Mr. Forley comes here--and I'll fetch; 
a candle in half a minute. It gets so dark in 
the evenings, now, you hardly know where 
you are, do you, sir? And how is good Mr. 
Forley in his health? We trust he is better, 
Benjamin, don't we? We are so sorry not 
to see him as usual, Benjamin, ain't we? 
In half a minute, sir, if you don't mind 
waiting, I'll be back with the candle. Come 
along, Benjamin." 
</p>
<p>
"Come along, Benjamin," chimes in the 
echo, and chuckles again as if he thought 
he had made another joke. 
</p>
<p>
Left alone in the empty front-parlour, 
Trottle wondered what was coming next, as he 
heard theshuffling, scraping footsteps go slowly 
down the kitchen-stairs. The front-door had 
been carefully chained up and bolted behind 
him on his entrance; and there was not the 
least chance of his being able to open it to 
effect his escape, without betraying himself 
by making a noise. 
</p>
<p>
Not being of the Jarber sort, luckily for 
himself, he took his situation quietly, as he 
found it, and turned his time, while alone, to 
account, by summing up in his own mind the 
few particulars which he had discovered thus 
far. He had found out, first, that Mr. Forley 
was in the habit of visiting the house regularly. 
Second, that Mr. Forley, being 
prevented by illness from seeing the people put 
in charge as usual, had appointed a friend to 
represent him; and had written to say so. 
Third, that the friend had a choice of two 
Mondays, at a particular time in the evening, 
for doing his errand: and that Trottle 
had accidentally hit on this time, and on the 
first of the Mondays, for beginning his own 
investigations. Fourth, that the similarity 
between Trottle's black dress, as servant out 
of livery, and the dress of the messenger 
(whoever he might be), had helped the error 
by which Trottle was profiting. So far, so 
good. But what was the messenger's errand 
and what chance was there that he might 
not come up and knock at the door himself, 
from minute to minute, on that very evening? 
</p>
<p>
While Trottle was turning over this last 
consideration in his mind, he heard the 
shuffling footsteps come up the stairs again, 
with a flash of candle-light going before 
them. He waited for the woman's coming 
in with some little anxiety; for the twilight 
had been too dim on his getting into the 
house to allow him to see either her face or 
the man's face at all clearly. 
</p>
<p>
The woman came in first, with the man 
she called Benjamin at her heels, and set the 
candle on the mantel-piece. Trottle takes 
leave to describe her as an offensively-cheerful 
old woman, awfully lean aud wiry, and 
sharp all over, at eyes, nose, and chin--
devilishly brisk, smiling, and restless, with a 
dirty false front and a dirty black cap, and 
short fidgetty arms, and long hooked finger-nails--
an unnaturally lusty old woman, who 
walked with a spring in her wicked old feet, 
and spoke with a smirk on her wicked old 
face--the sort of old woman (as Trottle 
thinks) who ought to have lived in the dark 
ages, and been ducked in a horse-pond, 
instead of flourishing in the nineteenth 
century, and taking charge of a Christian 
house. 
</p>
<p>
"You'll please to excuse my son, Benjamin, 
won't you, sir?" says this witch without a 
broomstick, pointing to the man behind her, 
propped against the bare wall of the dining-room, 
exactly as he had been propped against 
the bare wall of the passage. "He's got his 
inside dreadful bad again, has my son 
Benjamin. And he won't go to bed, and he will 
follow me about the house, up-stairs and 
down-stairs, and in my lady's chamber, as 
the song says, you know. It's his indisgestion, 
poor dear, that sours his temper and makes 
him so agravating--and indisgestion is a 
wearing thing to the best of us, ain't it, sir?" 
</p>
<p>
"Ain't it, sir?" chimes in agravating 
Benjamin, winking at the candle-light like an 
owl at the sunshine. 
</p>
<p>
Trottle examined the man curiously, while 
his horrid old mother was speaking of him. 
He found "My son Benjamin" to be little 
and lean, and buttoned-up slovenly in a 
frowsy old great-coat that fell down to his 
ragged carpet-slippers. His eyes were very 
watery, his cheeks very pale, and his lips 
very red. His breathing was so uncommonly 
loud, that it sounded almost like a snore. 
His head rolled helplessly in the monstrous 
big collar of his great-coat; and his limp, 
lazy hands pottered about the wall on either 
side of him, as if they were groping for an 
imaginary bottle. In plain English, the 
complaint of "My son Benjamin" was drunkenness, 
of the stupid, pig-headed, sottish kind. 
Drawing this conclusion easily enough, after 
a moment's observation of the man, Trottle 
found himself, nevertheless, keeping his eyes 
fixed much longer than was necessary on the 
ugly drunken face rolling about in the 
monstrous big coat collar, and looking at it 
with a curiosity that he could hardly account 
for at first. Was there something familiar 
to him in the man's features? He turned 
away from them for an instant, and then 
turned back to him again. After that second 
look, the notion forced itself into his mind, 
that he had certainly seen a face somewhere, 
of which that sot's face appeared like a kind 
of slovenly copy. "Where?" thinks he to 
himself, "where did I last see the man 
whom this agravatiug Benjamin, here, so 
very strongly reminds me of?" 
</p>
<p>
It was no time, just then--with the cheerful 
old woman's eye searching him all over, 
and the cheerful old woman's tongue talking 
at him, nineteen to the dozen--for Trottle to 
be ransacking his memory for small matters 
that had got into wrong corners of it. He 
put by in his mind that very curious 
circumstance respecting Benjamin's face, to be taken 
up again when a fit opportunity offered itself; 
and kept his wits about him in prime order 
for present necessities. 
</p>
<p>
"You wouldn't like to go down into the 
kitchen, would you?" says the witch without 
the broomstick, as familiar as if she had 
been Trottle's mother, instead of Benjamin's. 
</p>
<p>
"There's a bit of fire in the grate, and the 
sink in the back kitchen don't smell to matter 
much to-day, and it's uncommon chilly up 
here when a person's flesh don't hardly cover 
a person's bones. But you don't look cold, 
sir, do you? And then, why, Lord bless my 
soul, our little bit of business is so very, very 
little, it's hardly worth while to go downstairs 
about it, after all. Quite a game at 
business, ain't it, sir? Give-and-take--that's 
what I call it--give-and-take!" 
</p>
<p>
With that, her wicked old eyes settled 
hungrily on the region round about Trottle's 
waistcoat-pocket, and she began to chuckle 
like her son, holding out one of her skinny 
hands, and tapping cheerfully in the palm 
with the knuckles of the other. Agravating 
Benjamin, seeing what she was about, roused 
up a little, chuckled and tapped in imitation 
of her, got an idea of his own into his 
muddled head all of a sudden, and bolted it out 
charitably for the benefit of Trottle. 
</p>
<p>
"I say!" says Benjamin, settling himself 
against the wall and nodding his head 
viciously at his cheerful old mother. "I 
say! Look out. She'll skin you!" 
</p>
<p>
Assisted by these signs and warnings, 
Trottle found no difficulty in understanding 
that the business referred to was the giving 
and taking of money, and that he was 
expected to be the giver. It was at this stage 
of the proceedings that he first felt decidedly 
uncomfortable, and more than half inclined 
to wish he was on the street-side of the 
house-door again. 
</p>
<p>
He was still cudgelling his brains for an 
excuse to save his pocket, when the silence 
was suddenly interrupted by a sound in the 
upper part of the house. 
</p>
<p>
It was not at all loud it was a quiet, still, 
scraping sound so faint that it could hardly 
have reached the quickest ears, except in an 
empty house. 
</p>
<p>
"Do you hear that, Benjamin?" says the 
old woman. "He's at it again, even in the 
dark, ain't he? P'raps you'd like to see him, 
sir!" says she, turning on Trottle, and 
poking her grinning face close to him. "Only 
name it; only say if you'd like to see him 
before we do our little bit of business and 
I'll show good Forley's friend upstairs, just 
as if he was good Mr. Forley himself. My 
legs are all right, whatever Benjamin's may 
be. I get younger and younger, and stronger 
and stronger, and jollier and jollier, every 
day that's what I do! Don't mind the 
stairs on my account, sir, if you'd like to see 
him." 
</p>
<p>
"Him?" Trottle wondered whether 
"him," meant a man, or a boy, or a domestic 
animal of the male species. Whatever it 
meant, here was a chance of putting off that 
uncomfortable give-and-take-business, and, 
better still, a chance perhaps of finding out 
one of the secrets of the mysterious House. 
Trottle's spirits began to rise again, and 
he said "Yes," directly, with the confidence 
of a man who knew all about it. 
</p>
<p>
Benjamin's mother took the candle at once, 
and lighted Trottle briskly to the stairs; and 
Benjamin himself tried to follow as usual. 
But getting up several nights of stairs, even 
helped by the bannisters, was more, with his 
particular complaint, than he seemed to feel 
himself inclined to venture on. He sat down 
obstinately on the lowest step, with his head 
against the wall, and the tails of his big great 
coat spreading out magnificently on the 
stairs behind him and above him, like a dirty 
imitation of a court lady's train. 
</p>
<p>
"Don't sit there, dear," says his affectionate 
mother, stopping to snuff the candle on the 
first landing. 
</p>
<p>
"I shall sit here," says Benjamin, 
agravating to the last, "till the milk comes in the 
morning." 
</p>
<p>
The cheerful old woman went on nimbly 
up the stairs to the first-floor, and Trottle 
followed, with his eyes and ears wide open. 
He had seen nothing out of the common in 
the front parlour, or up the staircase, so far. 
The House was dirty and dreary and 
close-smelling--but there was nothing about it to 
excite the least curiosity, except the faint 
scraping sound, which was now beginning to 
get a little clearer--though still not at all 
loud--as Trottle followed his leader up the 
stairs to the second floor. 
</p>
<p>
Nothing on the second-floor landing, but 
cobwebs above and bits of broken plaster 
below, cracked off from the ceiling. 
Benjamin's mother was not a bit out of breath, and 
looked all ready to go to the top of the 
monument if necessary. The faint scraping sound 
had got a little clearer still; but Trottle was 
no nearer to guessing what it might be, than 
when he first heard it in the parlour 
downstairs. 
</p>
<p>
On the third, and last, floor, there were 
two doors; one, which was shut, leading into 
the front garret; and one, which was ajar, 
leading into the back garret. There was a loft 
in the ceiling above the landing; but the 
cobwebs all over it vouched sufficiently for its 
not having been opened for some little time. 
The scraping noise, plainer than ever here, 
sounded on the other side of the back garret 
door; and, to Trottle's great relief, that was 
precisely the door which the cheerful old 
woman now pushed open. 
</p>
<p>
Trottle followed her in; and, for once in 
his life, at any rate, was struck dumb with 
amazement, at the sight which the inside of 
the room revealed to him. 
</p>
<p>
The garret was absolutely empty of 
everything in the shape of furniture. It must 
have been used, at one time or other, by 
somebody engaged in a profession or a trade 
which required for the practice of it a great 
deal of light; for the one window in the room 
which looked out on a wide open space at the 
back of the house, was three or four times as 
large, every way, as a garret-window usually 
is. Close under this window, kneeling on 
the bare boards with his face to the door, 
there appeared, of all the creatures in the 
world to see alone at such a place and at 
such a time, a mere mite of a child--a little, 
lonely, wizen, strangely-clad boy, who could 
not at the most, have been more than five 
years old. He had a greasy old blue shawl 
crossed over his breast, and rolled up, to 
keep the ends from the ground, into a great 
big lump on his back. A strip of something 
which looked like the remains of a woman's 
flannel petticoat, showed itself under the 
shawl, and, below that again, a pair of rusty 
black stockings, worlds too large for him, 
covered his legs and his shoeless feet. A pair 
of old clumsy muffetees, which had worked 
themselves up on his little frail red arms to 
the elbows, and a big cotton nightcap that 
had dropped down to his very eyebrows, 
finished off the strange dress which the poor 
little man seemed not half big enough to fill 
out, and not near strong enough to walk 
about in. 
</p>
<p>
But there was something to see even more 
extraordinary than the clothes the child was 
swaddled up in, and that was the game which 
he was playing at, all by himself; and which, 
moreover, explained in the most unexpected 
manner the faint scraping noise that had 
found its way down-stairs, through the 
half-opened door, in the silence of the empty 
house. 
</p>
<p>
It has been mentioned that the child was 
on his knees in the garret, when Trottle first 
saw him. He was not saying his prayers, 
and not crouching down in terror at being 
alone in the dark. He was, odd and 
unaccountable as it may appear, doing nothing 
more or less than playing at a charwoman's 
or housemaid's business of scouring the floor. 
Both his little hands had tight hold of a 
mangy old blacking-brush, with hardly any 
bristles left in it, which he was rubbing 
backwards and forwards on the boards, as 
gravely and steadily as if he had been at 
scouring-work for years, and had got a large 
family to keep by it. The coming-in of 
Trottle and the old woman did not startle or 
disturb him in the least. He just looked up 
for a minute at the candle, with a pair of 
very bright, sharp eyes, and then went on 
with his work again, as if nothing had 
happened. On one side of him was a 
battered pint saucepan without a handle, which 
was his make-believe pail; and on the other 
a morsel of slate-coloured cotton rag, which 
stood for his flannel to wipe up with. After 
scrubbing bravely for a minute or two, he 
took the bit of rag, and mopped up, and 
then squeezed make-believe water out into 
his make-believe pail, as grave as any judge 
that ever sat on a Bench. By the time he 
thought he had got the floor pretty dry, he 
raised himself upright on his knees, and blew 
out a good long breath, and set his little red 
arms akimbo, and nodded at Trottle. 
</p>
<p>
"There!" says the child, knitting his 
little downy eyebrows into a frown. "Drat 
the dirt! I've cleaned up. Where's my 
beer?" 
</p>
<p>
Benjamin's mother chuckled till Trottle 
thought she would have choked herself. 
</p>
<p>
"Lord ha' mercy on us!" says she, "just 
hear the imp. You would never think he 
was only five years old, would you, sir? 
Please to tell good Mr. Forley you saw 
him going on as nicely as ever, playing 
at being me scouring the parlour floor, and 
calling for my beer afterwards. That's his 
regular game, morning, noon, and night--
he's never tired of it. Only look how snug 
we've been and dressed him. That's my 
shawl a keepin his precious little body 
warm, and Benjamin's nightcap a keepin his; 
precious little head warm, and Benjamin's 
stockings, drawed over his trowsers, a keepin 
his precious little legs warm. He's snug and 
happy if ever a imp was yet. 'Where's my 
beer! '--say it again, little dear, say it again!" 
</p>
<p>
If Trottle had seen the boy, with a light 
and a fire in the room, clothed like other 
children, and playing naturally with a top, or 
a box of soldiers, or a bouncing big 
india-rubber ball, he might have been as cheerful 
under the circumstances as Benjamin's mother 
herself. But seeing the child reduced (as he 
could not help suspecting) for want of proper 
toys and proper child's company, to take up 
with the mocking of an old woman at her 
scouring-work for something to stand in the 
place of a game, Trottle, though not a 
family man, nevertheless felt the sight before 
him to be, in its way, one of the saddest and 
the most pitiable that he had ever witnessed. 
</p>
<p>
"Why, my man," says he, "you're the 
boldest little chap in all England. You don't 
seem a bit afraid of being up here all by 
yourself in the dark." 
</p>
<p>
"The big winder," says the child, pointing 
up to it, "sees in the dark; and I see with 
the big winder." He stops a bit, and gets 
up on his legs, and looks hard at Benjamin's 
mother. "I'm a good 'un," says he, "ain't 
I? I save candle." 
</p>
<p>
Trottle wondered what else the forlorn 
little creature had been brought up to do 
without, besides candlelight; and risked 
putting a question as to whether he ever got 
a run in the open air to cheer him up a bit. 
O, yes, he had a run now and then, out of 
doors (to say nothing of his runs about the 
house), the lively little cricket--a run according 
to good Mr. Forley's instructions, which 
were followed out carefully, as good Mr. 
Forley's friend would be glad to hear, to the 
very letter. 
</p>
<p>
As Trottle could only have made one reply 
to this, namely, that good Mr. Forley's 
instructions were, in his opinion, the instructions 
of an infernal scamp; and as he felt 
that such an answer would naturally prove 
the death-blow to all further discoveries on 
his part, he gulped down his feelings before 
they got too many for him, and held his 
tongue, and looked round towards the window 
again to see what the forlorn little boy was 
going to amuse himself with next. 
</p>
<p>
The child had gathered up his blacking 
brush and bit of rag, and had put them into 
the old tin saucepan; and was now working 
his way, as well as his clothes would let him, 
with his rnake-believe pail hugged up in his 
arms, towards a door of communication which 
led from the back to the front garret. 
</p>
<p>
"I say," says he, looking round sharply 
over his shoulder, "what are you two stopping 
here for! I'm going to bed now--and so I 
tell you!" 
</p>
<p>
With that, he opened the door, and walked 
into the front room. Seeing Trottle take a 
step or two to follow him, Benjamin's mother 
opened her wicked old eyes in a state of great 
astonishment. 
</p>
<p>
"Mercy on us!" says she, "haven't you 
seen enough of him yet?" 
</p>
<p>
"No," says Trottle. "I should like to see 
him go to bed." 
</p>
<p>
Benjamin's mother burst into such a fit of 
chuckling that the loose extinguisher in the 
candlestick clattered again with the shaking 
of her hand. To think of good Mr. Forley's 
friend taking ten times more trouble about 
the imp than good Mr. Forley himself! 
Such a joke as that, Benjamin's mother 
had not often met with in the course of 
her life, and she begged to be excused if she 
took the liberty of having a laugh at it. 
</p>
<p>
Leaving her to laugh as much as she 
pleased, and coming to a pretty positive 
conclusion, after what he had just heard, that 
Mr. Forley's interest in the child was not of 
the fondest possible kind, Trottle walked into 
the front room, and Benjamin's mother, 
enjoying herself immensely, followed with the 
candle. 
</p>
<p>
There were two pieces of furniture in the 
front garret. One, an old stool of the sort 
that is used to stand a cask of beer on; and 
the other a great big ricketty straddling old 
truckle bedstead. In the middle of this 
bed-stead, surrounded by a dim brown waste of 
sacking, was a kind of little island of poor 
bedding--an old bolster, with nearly all the 
feathers out of it, doubled in three for a 
pillow; a mere shred of patchwork counterpane, 
and a blanket; and under that, and 
peeping out a little on either side beyond the 
loose clothes, two faded chair cushions of 
horsehair, laid along together for a sort of 
makeshift mattress. When Trottle got into 
the room, the lonely little boy had scrambled 
up on the bedstead with the help of the 
beer-stool, and was kneeling on the outer rim of 
sacking with the shred of counterpane in his 
hands, just making ready to tuck it in for 
himself under the chair cushions. 
</p>
<p>
"I'll tuck you up, my man," says Trottle. 
"Jump into bed, and let me try." 
</p>
<p>
" I mean to tuck myself up," says the poor 
forlorn child, "and I don't mean to jump. I 
mean to crawl, I do--and so I tell you!" 
</p>
<p>
With that, he set to work, tucking in the 
clothes tight all down the sides of the 
cushions, but leaving them open at the foot. 
Then, getting up on his knees, and looking 
hard at Trottle, as much as to say, "What 
do you mean by offering to help such a handy 
little chap as me?" he began to untie the 
big shawl for himself, and did it, too, in less 
than half a minute. Then, doubling the 
shawl up loose over the foot of the bed, he 
says, "I say, look here," and ducks under 
the clothes, head first, worming his way up 
and up softly, under the blanket and 
counterpane, till Trottle saw the top of the large 
nightcap slowly peep out on the bolster. This 
over-sized head-gear of the child's had so 
shoved itself down in the course of his journey 
to the pillow, under the clothes, that when 
he got his face fairly out on the bolster, he 
was all nightcap down to his mouth. He soon 
freed himself, however, from this slight 
encumbrance by turning the ends of the cap up 
gravely to their old place over his eyebrows--
looked at Trottle--said, "Snug, ain't it? 
Good-bye! "--popped his face under the 
clothes again--and left nothing to be seen of 
him but the empty peak of the big nightcap 
standing up sturdily on end in the middle of 
the bolster. 
</p>
<p>
"What a young limb it is, ain't it?" says 
Benjamin's mother, giving Trottle a cheerful 
dig with her elbow. "Come on! you won't 
see no more of him to-night! "--
</p>
<p>
"And so I tell you!" sings out a shrill, 
little voice under the bedclothes, chiming in 
with a playful finish to the old woman's last 
words. 
</p>
<p>
If Trottle had not been, by this time, 
positively resolved to follow the wicked secret 
which accident had mixed him up with, 
through all its turnings and windings, 
right on to the end, he would have probably 
snatched the boy up then and there, and 
carried him off from his garret prison, 
bed-clothes and all. As it was, he put a strong 
check on himself, kept his eye on future 
possibilities, and allowed Benjamin's mother to 
lead him down-stairs again. 
</p>
<p>
"Mind them top bannisters," says she, as 
Trottle laid his hand on them. "They are as 
rotten as medlars every one of 'em." 
</p>
<p>
"When people come to see the premises," 
says Trottle, trying to feel his way a little 
farther into the mystery of the House, "you 
don't bring many of them up here, do 
you?" 
</p>
<p>
"Bless your heart alive!" says she, 
"nobody ever comes now. The outside of the 
house is quite enough to warn them off. 
More's the pity, as I say. It used to keep 
me in spirits, staggering 'em all, one after 
another, with the frightful high rent--specially 
the women, drat 'em.; What's the rent: 
of this house?'--'Hundred and twenty 
pound a-year?' 'Hundred and twenty? 
why, there ain't a house in the street as lets 
for more than eighty!'--'Likely enough, 
ma'am; other landlords may lower their 
rent.s if they please; but this here landlord 
sticks to his rights, and means to have as 
much for his house as his father had before 
him!'--'But the neighbourhood's gone off 
since then!'--'Hundred and twenty pound, 
ma'am.'--'The landlord must be mad!'--
'Hundred and twenty pound, ma'am.'--
'Open the door you impertinent woman!' 
Lord! what a happiness it was to see 'em 
bounce out, with that awful rent a-ringing 
in their ears all down the street!" 
</p>
<p>
She stopped on the second-floor landing to 
treat herself to another chuckle, while Trottle 
privately posted up in his memory what he 
had just heard. "Two points made out," he 
thought to himself: "the house is kept empty 
on purpose, and the way it's done is to ask a 
rent that nobody will pay." 
</p>
<p>
"Ah, deary me!" says Benjamin's mother, 
changing the subject on a sudden, and twisting 
back with a horrid, greedy quickness to 
those awkward money-matters which she had 
broached down in the parlour. "What we've 
done, one way and another for Mr. Forley, it 
isn't in words to tell! That nice little bit of 
business of ours ought to be a bigger bit of 
business, considering the trouble we take, 
Benjamin and me, to make the imp up-stairs 
as happy as the day is long. If good Mr. 
Forley would only please to think a little 
more of what a deal he owes to Benjamin 
and me" 
</p>
<p>
"That's just it," says Trottle, catching her 
up short in desperation, and seeing his way, 
by the help of those last words of hers to 
slipping cleverly through her fingers. "What 
should you say, if I told you that Mr. Forley 
was nothing like so far from thinking 
about that little matter as you fancy? You 
would be disappointed, now, if I told you 
that I had come to-day without the money '?"--
(her lank old jaw fell, and her villauous 
old eyes glared, in a perfect state of panic, 
at that! )--" But what should you say, if I 
told you that Mr. Forley was only waiting 
for my report, to send me here next Monday, 
at dusk, with a bigger bit of business 
for us two to do together than ever you 
think for? What should you say to 
that?" 
</p>
<p>
The old wretch came so near to Trottle, 
before she answered, and jammed him up 
confidentially so close into the corner of the 
landing, that his throat, in a manner, rose at 
her. 
</p>
<p>
"Can you count it off, do you think, on 
more than that?" says she, holding up her 
four skinny fingers and her long crooked 
thumb, all of a tremble, right before his face. 
</p>
<p>
"What do you say to two hands, instead of 
one?" says he, pushing past her, and getting 
down-stairs as fast as he could. 
</p>
<p>
What she said Trottle thinks it best not to 
report, seeing that the old hypocrite, getting 
next door to light-headed at tne golden 
prospect before her, took such liberties with 
unearthly names and persons which ought never 
to have approached her lips, and rained down 
such an awful shower of blessings on Trottle's 
head, that his hair almost stood on end to 
hear her. He went on down-stairs as fast as 
his feet would carry him, till he was brought 
up all standing, as the sailors say, on the last 
flight, by agravating Benjamin, lying right 
across the stair, and fallen off, as might have 
been expected, into a heavy drunken sleep. 
</p>
<p>
The sight of him instantly reminded Trottle 
of the curious half likeness which he had 
already detected between the face of Benjamin 
and the face of another man, whom he 
had seen at a past time in very different 
circumstances. He determined, before leaving 
the House, to have one more look at the 
wretched muddled creature; and accordingly 
shook him up smartly, and propped him 
against the staircase wall, before his mother 
could interfere. 
</p>
<p>
"Leave him to me; I'll freshen him up," 
says Trottle to the old woman, looking hard 
in Benjamin's face, while he spoke. 
</p>
<p>
The fright and surprise of being suddenly 
woke up, seemed, for about a quarter of a 
minute, to sober the creature. When he 
first opened his eyes, there was a new look in 
them for a moment, which struck home to 
Trottle's memory as quick and as clear as a 
flash of light. The old maudlin sleepy 
expression came back again in another instant, 
and blurred out all further signs and tokens 
of the past. But Trottle had seen enough in 
the moment before it came; and he troubled 
Benjamin's face with no more inquiries. 
</p>
<p>
"Next Monday, at dusk," says he, cutting 
short some more of the old woman's 
palaver about Benjamin's indisgestion. "I've 
got no more time to spare, ma'am, to-night: 
please to let me out." 
</p>
<p>
With a few last blessings, a few last dutiful 
messages to good Mr. Forley, and a few last 
friendly hints not to forget next Monday at 
dusk, Trottle contrived to struggle through 
the sickening business of leave-taking; to 
get the door opened; and to find himself, to 
his own indescribable relief, once more on 
the outer side of the House To Let. 
</p>

<title>Let At Last.</title>
<p>
"THERE, ma'am!" said Trottle, folding up 
the manuscript from which he had been 
reading, and setting it down with a smart tap 
of triumph on the table. "May I venture to 
ask what you think of that plain statement, 
as a guess on my part (and not on Mr.  
Jarber's) at the riddle of the empty House?" 
</p>
<p>
For a minute or two I was unable to say 
a word. When I recovered a little, my first 
question referred to the poor forlorn little 
boy. 
</p>
<p>
"To-day is Monday the twentieth," I said. 
"Surely you have not let a whole week go by 
without trying to find out something more?" 
</p>
<p>
"Except at bed-time, and meals, ma'am," 
answered Trottle, "I have not let an hour 
go by. Please to understand that I have 
only come to an end of what I have written, 
and not to an end of what I have done. I 
wrote down those first particulars, ma'am, 
because they are of great importance, and 
also because I was determined to come 
forward with my written documents, seeing 
that Mr. Jarber chose to come forward, in 
the first instance, with his. I am now ready 
to go on with the second part of my story 
as shortly and plainly as possible, by word 
of mouth. The first thing I must clear up, 
if you please, is the matter of Mr. Forley's 
family affairs. I have heard you speak of 
them, ma'am, at various times; and I have 
understood that Mr. Forley had two children 
only by his deceased wife, both daughters. 
The eldest daughter married, to her father's 
entire satisfaction, one Mr. Bayne, a rich 
man, holding a high government situation 
in Canada. She is now living there with her 
husband, and her only child, a little girl of 
eight or nine years old. Right so far, I 
think, ma'am?" 
</p>
<p>
"Quite right," I said. 
</p>
<p>
"Tlie second daughter," Trotfcle went on, 
"and Mr. Forley's favourite, set her father's 
wishes and the opinions of the world at flat 
defiance, by running away with a man of low 
origin--a mate of a merchant-vessel, named 
Kirkland. Mr. Forley not only never 
forgave that marriage, but vowed that he would 
visit the scandal of it heavily in the future 
on husband and wife. Both escaped his 
vengeance, whatever he meant it to be. The 
husband was drowned on his first voyage 
after his marriage, and the wife died in 
child-bed. Right again, I believe, ma'am?" 
</p>
<p>
"Again quite right." 
</p>
<p>
"Having got the family matter all right, 
we will now go back, ma'am, to me and 
my doings. Last Monday, I asked you 
for leave of absence for two days; I 
employed the time in clearing up the matter 
of Benjamin's face. Last Saturday I was out 
of the way when you wanted me. I played 
truant, ma'am, on that occasion, in company 
with a friend of mine, who is managing clerk 
in a lawyer's office; and we both spent the 
morning at Doctors' Commons, over the last 
will and testament of Mr. Forley's father. 
Leaving the will-business for a moment, 
please to follow me first, if you have no 
objection, into the ugly subject of 
Benjamin's face. About six or seven years ago 
(thanks to your kindness) I had a week's 
holiday with some friends of mine who live 
in the town of Pendlebury. One of those 
friends (the only one now left in the place) 
kept a chemist's shop, and in that shop I was 
made acquainted with one of the two doctors 
in the town, named Barsham. This Barsham 
was a first-rate surgeon, and might have got 
to the top of his profession, if he had not 
been a first-rate blackguard. As it was, he 
both drank and gambled; nobody would have 
anything to do with him in Pendlebury; and, 
at the time when I was made known to him 
in the chemist's shop, the other doctor, Mr. 
Dix, who was not to be compared with him 
for surgical skill, but who was a respectable 
man, had got all the practice; and Barsham 
and his old mother were living together in 
such a condition of utter poverty, that it was 
a marvel to everybody how they kept out of 
the parish workhouse." 
</p>
<p>
"Benjamin and Benjamin's mother!" 
"Exactly, ma'am. Last Thursday morning 
(thanks to your kindness, again) I went to 
Pendlebury to my friend the chemist, to 
ask a few questions about Barsham and his 
mother. I was told that they had both 
left the town about five years since. When 
I inquired into the circumstances, some 
strange particulars came out in the course 
of the chemist's answer. You know I have 
no doubt, ma'am, that poor Mrs. Kirkland 
was confined while her husband was at sea, 
in lodgings at a village called Flatfield, 
and that she died and was buried there. 
But what you may not know is, that 
Flatfield is only three miles from Pendlebury; 
that the doctor who attended on Mrs. 
Kirkland was Barsham; that the nurse who took 
care of her was Barsham's mother; and that 
the person who called them both in, was Mr. 
Forley. Whether his daughter wrote to him, 
or whether he heard of it in some other way, 
I don't know; but he was with her (though 
he had sworn never to see her again when 
she married) a month or more before her 
confinement, and was backwards and forwards a 
good deal between Flatfield and Peudlebury. 
How he managed matters with the Barshams 
cannot at present be discovered; but it is a 
fact that he contrived to keep the drunken 
doctor sober, to everybody's amazement. It 
is a fact that Barsham went to the poor 
woman with all his wits about him. It 
is a fact that he and his mother came 
back from Flatfield after Mrs. Kirkland's 
death, packed up what few things they had, 
and left the town mysteriously by night. 
And, lastly, it is also a fact that the other 
doctor, Mr. Dix, was not called in to help, 
till a week after the birth and burial of the 
child, when the mother was sinking from 
exhaustion--exhaustion (to give the vagabond, 
Barsham, his due) not produced, in Mr. Dix's 
opinion, by improper medical treatment, but 
by the bodily weakness of the poor woman 
herself--" 
</p>
<p>
"Burial of the child?" I interrupted, 
trembling ail over. "Trottle! you spoke 
that word 'burial,' in a very strange way--
you are fixing your eyes on me now with a 
very strange look--" 
</p>
<p>
TrQttle leaned over close to me, and pointed 
through the window to the empty house. 
</p>
<p>
"The child's death is registered, at 
Pendlebury," he said, "on Barsham's certificate, 
under the head of Male Infant, Still-Born. 
The child's coffin lies in the mother's grave, 
in Flattield churchyard. The child himself 
as surely--as I live and breathe, is living and 
breathing now--a castaway and a prisoner 
in that villainous house!" 
</p>
<p>
I sank back in my chair. 
</p>
<p>
"It's guess-work, so far, but it is borne 
in on my mind, for all that, as truth. 
Rouse yourself, ma'am, and think a little. 
The last I hear of Barsham, he is attending 
Mr. Forley's disobedient daughter. The 
next I see of Barsham, he is in Mr. 
Forley's house, trusted with a secret. He 
and his mother leave Pendlebury suddenly 
and suspiciously five years back; and he 
and his mother have got a child of five 
years old, hidden away in the house. Wait! 
please to wait--I have not done yet. The 
will left by Mr. Forley's father, strengthens 
the suspicion. The friend I took with me to 
Doctors' Commons, made himself master of 
the contents of that will; and when he had 
done so, I put these two questions to him. 
' Can Mr. Forley leave his money at his own 
discretion to anybody he pleases?' 'No,' 
my friend says, 'his father has left him with 
only a life interest in it.' 'Suppose one of 
Mr. Forley's married daughters has a girl, 
and the other a boy, how would the money 
go?' 'It would all go,' my friend says, 'to the 
boy, and it would be charged with the 
payment of a certain annual income to his female 
cousin. After her death, it would go back to 
the male descendant, and to his heirs.' 
Consider that, ma'am! The child of the 
daughter whom Mr. Forley hates, whose husband 
has been snatched away from his vengeance 
by death, takes his whole property in defiance 
of him; and the child of the daughter whom 
he loves, is left a pensioner on her low-born 
boy-cousin for life! There was good--too 
good reason--why that child of Mrs. 
Kirkland's should be registered still-born. And 
if, as I believe, the register is founded on a 
false certificate, there is better, still better 
reason, why the existence of the child should 
be hidden, and all trace of his parentage 
blotted out, in the garret of that empty 
house." 
</p>
<p>
He stopped, and pointed for the second 
time to the dim, dust-covered 
garret-windows opposite. As he did so, I was startled--
a very slight matter sufficed to frighten me 
now--by a knock at the door of the room in 
which we were sitting. 
</p>
<p>
My maid came in, with a letter in her 
hand. I took it from her. The mourning 
card, which was all the envelope enclosed, 
dropped from my hands. 
</p>
<p>
George Forley was no more. He had 
departed this life three days since, on the 
evening of Friday. 
</p>
<p>
"Did our last chance of discovering the 
truth," I asked, "rest with him? Has it 
died with his death?" 
</p>
<p>
" Courage, ma'am! I think not. Our 
chance rests on our power to make Barsham 
and his mother confess; and Mr. Forley's death, 
by leaving them helpless, seems to put that 
power into our hands. With your permission, 
I will not wait till dusk to-day, as I at 
first intended, but will make sure of those 
two people at once. With a policeman in plain 
clothes to watch the house, in case they try to 
leave it; with this card to vouch for the fact of 
Mr. Forley's death; and with a bold 
acknowledgment on my part of having got 
possession of their secret, and of being ready to use 
it against them in case of need, I think there 
little doubt of bringing Barsham and his 
mother to terms. In case I find it impossible 
to get back here before dusk, please to sit 
near the window, ma'am, and watch the 
house, a little before they light the 
streetlamps. If you see the front-door open and 
close again, will you be good enough to put 
on your bonnet, and come across to me 
immediately? Mr. Forley's death may, or 
may not, prevent his messenger from coming 
as arranged. But, if the person does come, it 
is of importance that you, as a relative of 
Mr. Forley's, should be present to see him, 
and to have that proper influence over him 
which I cannot pretend to exercise." 
</p>
<p>
The only words I could say to Trottle as 
he opened the door and left me, were words 
charging him to take care that no harm 
happened to the poor forlorn little boy. 
</p>
<p>
Left alone, I drew my chair to the window; 
and looked out with a beating heart at the 
guilty house. I waited and waited through 
what appeared to me to be be an endless time, 
until I heard the wheels of a cab stop 
at the end of the street. I looked in that 
direction, and saw Trottle get out of the cab 
alone, walk up to the House, and knock at 
the door. He was let in by Barsham's 
mother. A minute or two later, a decently-dressed 
man sauntered past the house, looked 
up at it for a moment, and sauntered on to 
the corner of the street close by. Here he 
leant against the post, and lighted a cigar, and 
stopped there smoking in an idle way, but 
keeping his face always turned in the 
direction of the house-door. 
</p>
<p>
I waited and waited still. I waited and 
waited, my eyes riveted to the door of 
the house. At last I thought I saw it open 
in the dusk, and then felt sure I heard it 
shut again softly. Though I tried hard 
to compose myself, I trembled so that I was 
obliged to call for Peggy to help me on 
with my bonnet and cloak, and was forced to 
take her arm to lean on, in crossing the 
street. 
</p>
<p>
Trottle opened the door to us, before we 
could knock. Peggy went back, and I went 
in. He had a lighted candled in his hand. 
</p>
<p>
"It has happened ma'am, as I thought it 
would," he whispered, leading me into the 
bare, comfortless, empty parlour. "Barsham 
and his mother have consulted their own 
interests, and have come to terms. My 
guess-work is guess-work no longer. It is 
now what I felt it was--Truth!" 
</p>
<p>
Something strange to me--something 
which women who are mothers must often 
know--trembled suddenly in my heart, and 
brought the warm tears of my youthful days 
thronging back into my eyes. I took my 
faithful old servant by the hand, and asked 
him to let me see Mrs. Kirkland's child, for 
his mother's sake. 
</p>
<p>
"If you desire it, ma'am," said Trottle, 
with a gentleness of manner that I had never 
noticed in him before. "But pray don't 
think rne wanting in duty and right feeling, 
if I beg you to try and wait a little. You 
are agitated already, and the first meeting 
with the child will not help to make you so 
calm, as you would wish to be, if Mr Forley's 
messenger comes. The little boy is safe 
upstairs. Pray think of trying to compose 
yourself for a meeting with a stranger; and 
believe me you shall not leave the house 
afterwards without the child." 
</p>
<p>
I felt that Trottle was right, and sat down 
as patiently as I could in a chair he had 
thoughtfully placed ready for me. I was 
so horrified at the discovery of my own 
relation's wickedness that when Trottle 
proposed to make me acquainted with the 
confession wrung from Barsham and his mother, 
I begged him to spare me all details, and 
only to tell me what was necessary about 
George Forley. 
</p>
<p>
"All that can be said for Mr. Forley, ma'am, 
is, that he was just scrupulous enough to hide 
the child's existence and blot out its parentage 
here, instead of consenting, at the first, to 
its death, or afterwards, when the boy grew 
up, to turning him adrift, absolutely helpless 
in the world. The fraud has been managed, 
ma'am, with the cunning of Satan himself. 
Mr. Forley had the hold over the Barshams, 
that they had helped him in his villany, and 
that they were dependent on him for the 
bread they eat. He brought them up to 
London to keep them securely under his 
own eye. He put them into this empty 
house (taking it out of the agent's hands 
previously, on pretence that he meant to manage 
the letting of it himself); and by keeping the 
house empty, made it the surest of all hiding 
places for the child. Here, Mr. Forley could 
come, whenever he pleased, to see that the 
poor lonely child was not absolutely starved; 
sure that his visits would only appear like 
looking after his own property. Here the 
child was to have been trained to believe 
himself Barsham's child, till he should be 
old enough to be provided for in some 
situation, as low and as poor as Mr. Forley's 
uneasy conscience would let him pick out. 
He may have thought of atonement on his 
death-bed; but not before--I am only too 
certain of it--not before!" 
</p>
<p>
A low, double knock startled us. 
</p>
<p>
"The messenger!" said Trottle, under his 
breath. He went out instantly to answer the 
knock; and returned, leading in a respectable-looking 
elderly man, dressed like Trottle, all 
in black, with a white cravat, but otherwise 
not at all resembling him. 
</p>
<p>
"I am afraid I have made some mistake," 
said the stranger. 
</p>
<p>
Trottle, considerately taking the office of 
explanation into his own hands, assured the 
gentleman that there was no mistake; 
mentioned to him who I was; and asked him if 
he had not come on business connected wish 
the late Mr. Forley. Looking greatly 
astonished, the gentleman answered, "Yes." 
There was an awkward moment of silence, 
after that. The stranger seemed to be not 
only startled and amazed, but rather 
distrustful and fearful of committing himself as 
well. Noticing this, I thought it best to 
request Trottle to put an end to further 
embarrassment, by stating all particulars 
truthfully, as he had stated them to me; and 
I begged the gentleman to listen patiently 
for the late Mr. Forley's sake. He bowed 
to me very respectfully, and said he was 
prepared to listen with the greatest interest. 
</p>
<p>
It was evident to me and, I could see, to 
Trottle also that we were not dealing, to 
say the least, with a dishonest man. 
</p>
<p>
"Before I offer any opinion on what I 
have heai'd," he said, earnestly and anxiously, 
after Trottle had done, "I must be allowed, 
in justice to myself, to explain my own 
apparent connection with this very strange 
and very shocking business. I was the 
confidential legal adviser of the late Mr. Forley, 
and I am left his executor. Rather more 
than a fortnight back, when Mr. Forley was 
confined to his room by illness, he sent for 
me, and charged me to call and pay a certain 
sum of money here, to a man and woman 
whom I should find taking charge of the 
house. He said he had reasons for wishing 
the affair to be kept a secret. He begged me 
so to arrange my engagements that I could 
call at this place either on Monday last, or 
to-day, at dusk; and he mentioned that he 
would write to warn the people of my 
coning, without mentioning my name 
(Dalcott is my name) as he did not wish 
to expose me to any future importunities on 
the part of the man and woman. I need 
hardly tell you that this commission struck me 
as being a strange one; but, in my position with 
Mr. Forley, I had no resource but to accept 
it without asking questions, or to break off 
my long and friendly connection with my 
client. I chose the first alternative. Business 
prevented me from doing my errand on 
Monday last and if I am here to-day, 
notwithstanding Mr. Forley's unexpected death, 
it is emphatically because I understood 
nothing of the matter, on knocking at this 
door; and therefore felt myself bound, as 
executor, to clear it up. That, on my word 
of honour, is the whole truth, so far as I am 
personally concerned." 
</p>
<p>
"I feel quite sure of it, sir," I answered. 
"You mentioned Mr. Forley's death, just 
now, as unexpected. May I inquire if you 
were present, and if he has left any last 
instructions?" 
</p>
<p>
"Three hours before Mr. Forley's death," 
said Mr. Dalcott, "his medical attendant left 
him apparently in a fair way of recovery. 
The change for the worse took place so 
suddenly, and was accompanied by such severe 
suffering, as entirely to prevent him from 
communicating his last wishes to any one. 
When I reached his house, he was insensible. 
I have since examined his papers. Not one 
of them refers to the present time, or to the 
serious matter which now occupies us. In 
the absence of instructions, I must act 
cautiously on what you have told me; but 
I will be rigidly fair and just at the same 
time. The first thing to be done," he 
continued, addressing himself to Trottle, 
"is to hear what the man and woman, 
down-stairs, have to say. If you can supply 
me with writing-materials, I will take their 
declarations separately on the spot, in your 
presence, and in the presence of the 
policeman who is watching the house. 
Tomorrow I will send copies of those declarations, 
accompanied by a full statement of the 
case, to Mr. and Mrs. Bayne in Canada (both 
of whom know me well as the late Mr. 
Foi'ley's legal adviser); and I will suspend 
all proceedings, on my part, until I hear from 
them, or from their solicitor in London. In 
the present posture of affairs this is all I can 
safely do." 
</p>
<p>
We could do no less than agree with him, 
and thank him for his frank and honest 
manner of meeting us. It was arranged 
that I should send over the writing materials 
from my lodgings; and, to my unutterable 
joy and relief, it was also readily 
acknowledged that the poor little orphan boy could 
find no fitter refuge than my old arms were 
longing to offer him, and no safer protection 
for the night than my roof could give. 
Trottle hastened away up-stairs, as actively 
as if he had been a young man, to fetch the 
child down. 
</p>
<p>
And he brought him down to me without 
another moment of delay, and I went on 
my knees before the poor little Mite, and 
embraced him, and asked him if he would go 
with me to where I lived? He held me 
away for a moment, and his wan, shrewd 
little eyes looked sharp at me. Then h 
clung close to rne all at once, and said: 
</p>
<p>
"I'm a-going along with you, I am and 
so I tell you!" 
</p>
<p>
For inspiring the poor neglected child with 
this trust in my old self, I thanked Heaven, 
then, with all my heart and soul, and I thank 
it now! 
</p>
<p>
I bundled the poor darling up in my own 
cloak, and I carried him in my own arms 
across the road. Peggy was lost in speechless 
amazement to behold me trudging out of 
breath up-stairs, with a strange pair of poor 
little legs under my arm; but, she began to 
cry over the child the moment slie saw him, 
like a sensible woman as she always was, 
and she still cried her eyes out over him in a 
comfortable manner, when he at last lay fast 
asleep, tucked up by my hands in Trottle's 
bed. 
</p>
<p>
"And Trottle, bless you, my dear man," 
said I, kissing his hand, as he looked 
on: "the forlorn baby came to this refuge 
through you, and he will help you on your 
way to Heaven."

Trottle answered that I was his dear 
mistress, and immediately went and put his 
head out at an open window on the landing, 
and looked into the back street for a quarter 
of an hour. 
</p>
<p>
That very night, as I sat thinking of the 
poor child, and of another poor child who 
is never to be thought about enough at 
Christmas-time, the idea came into my mind 
which I have lived to execute, and in the 
realisation of which I am the happiest of 
women this day. 
</p>
<p>
"The executor will sell that House, 
Trottle?" said I. 
</p>
<p>
"Not a doubt of it, ma'am, if he can find 
a purchaser." 
</p>
<p>
"I'll buy it." 
</p>
<p>
I have often seen Trottle pleased; but, I 
never saw him so perfectly enchanted as he 
was when I confided to him, which I did. 
then and there, the purpose that I had 
in view. 
</p>
<p>
To make short of a long story--and what 
story would not be long, coming from the 
lips of an old woman like me, unless it was 
made short by main force!--I bought the 
House. Mrs. Bayne had her father's blood 
in her; she evaded the opportunity of 
forgiving and generous reparation that was 
oft'ered her, and disowned the chiid; but, I 
was prepared for that, and, loved him all the 
more for having no one in the world to 
look to, but me. 
</p>
<p>
I am getting into a flurry by being 
over-pleased, and I dare say I am as incoherent as 
need be. I bought the House, and I altered 
it from the basement to the roof, and I 
turned it into a Hospital for Sick Children. 
</p>
<p>
Never mind by what degrees my little 
adopted boy came to the knowledge of all the 
sights and sounds in the streets, so familiar 
to other children and so strange to him; 
never mind by what degrees he came to be 
pretty, and childish, and winning, and 
companionable, and to have pictures and toys 
about him, and suitable playmates. As I 
write, I look across the road to my Hospital, 
and there is the darling (who has gone over 
to play) nodding at me out of one of the once 
lonely windows, with his dear chubby face 
backed up by Trottle's waistcoat as he lifts 
my pet for "Grandma" to see. 
</p>
<p>
Many an Eye I see in that House now, but 
it is never in solitude, never in neglect. 
Many an Eye I see in that House now, that is 
more and more radiant every day with the 
light of returning health. As my precious 
darling has changed beyond description for 
the brighter and the better, so do the not 
less precious darlings of poor women change 
in that House every day in the year. For 
which I humbly thank that Gracious Being 
whom the restorer of the Widow's son and of 
the Ruler's daughter, instructed all mankind 
to call their Father.
