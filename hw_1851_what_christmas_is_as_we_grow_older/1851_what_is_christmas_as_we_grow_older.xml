<title>WHAT CHRISTMAS IS, AS WE GROW OLDER.</title>
<p>
T<sc>IME</sc> was, with most of us, when Christmas Day encircling all our limited world like a magic ring, left nothing out for us to miss or seek; bound together all our home enjoyments, affections, and hopes; grouped every thing and every one around the Christmas fire; and made the little picture shining in our bright young eyes, complete.
</p>
<p>
Time came, perhaps, all so soon! when our thoughts overleaped that narrow boundary when there was some one (very dear, we thought then, very beautiful, and absolutely perfect) wanting to the fulness of our happiness; when we were wanting too (or we thought so, which did just as well) at the Christmas hearth by which that some one sat; and when we intertwined with every wreath and garland of our life that some one's name.
</p>
<p>
That was the time for the bright visionary Christmases which have long arisen from us to shew faintly, after summer rain, in the palest edges of the rainbow! That was the time for the beatified enjoyment of the things that were to be, and never were, and yet the things that were so real in our resolute hope that it would be hard to say, now, what realities achieved since, have been stronger!
</p>
<p>
What! Did that Christmas never really come when we and the priceless pearl who was our young choice were received, after the happiest of totally impossible marriages, by the two united families previously at daggers-drawn on our account? When brothers and sisters in law who had always been rather cool to us before our relationship was effected, perfectly doted on us. and when fathers and mothers overwhelmed us with unlimited incomes? Was that Christmas dinner never really eaten, after which we arose, and generously and eloquently rendered honor to our late rival, present in the company, then and there exchanging friendship and forgiveness, and founding an attachment, not surpassed in Greek or Roman story, which subsisted until death? Has that same rival long ceased to care for that same priceless pearl, and married for money, and become usurious? Above all, do we really know, now, that we should probably have been miserable if we had won and worn the pearl, and that we are better without her?
</p>
<p>
That Christmas when we had recently achieved so much fame; when we had been carried in triumph somewhere, for doing something great and good; when we had won an honored and ennobled name, and arrived and were received at home in a shower of tears of joy; is it possible that that Christmas has not come yet?
</p>
<p>
And is our life here, at the best, so constituted that, pausing as we advance at such a noticeable mile-stone in the track as this great birthday, we look back on the things that never were, as naturally and full as gravely as on the things that have been and are gone, or have been and still are? If it be so, and so it seems to be, must we come to the conclusion, that life is little better than a dream, and little worth the loves and strivings that we crowd into it?
</p>
<p>
No! Far be such miscalled philosophy from us, dear Reader, on Christmas Day! Nearer and closer to our hearts be the Christmas spirit, which is the spirit of active usefulness, perseverance, cheerful discharge of duty, kindness, and forbearance! It is in the last virtues especially, that we are, or should be, strengthened by the unaccomplished visions of our youth; for, who shall say that they are not our teachers to deal gently even with the impalpable nothings of the earth!
</p>
<p>
Therefore, as we grow older, let us be more thankful that the circle of our Christmas associations and of the lessons that they bring, expands! Let us welcome every one of them, and summon them to take their places by the Christmas hearth.
</p>
<p>
Welcome, old aspirations, glittering creatures of an ardent fancy, to your shelter underneath the holly! We know you, and have not outlived you yet. Welcome, old projects and old loves, however fleeting, to your nooks among the steadier lights that burn around us. Welcome, all that was ever real to our hearts; and for the earnestness that made you real, thanks to Heaven! Do we build no Christmas castles in the clouds now? Let our thoughts, fluttering like butterflies among these flowers of children, bear witness! Before this boy, there stretches out a Future, brighter than we ever looked on in our old romantic time, but bright with honor and with truth. Around this little head on which the sunny curls lie heaped, the graces sport, as prettily, as airily, as when there was no scythe within the reach of Time to shear away the curls of our first-love. Upon another girl's face near it--placider but smiling bright--a quiet and contented little face, we see Home fairly written. Shining from the word, as rays shine from a star, we see how, when our graves are old, other hopes than ours are young, other hearts than ours are moved; how other ways are smoothed; how other happiness blooms, ripens, and decays--no, not decays, for other homes and other bands of children, not yet in being nor for ages yet to be, arise, and bloom and ripen to the end of all!
</p>
<p>
Welcome, everything! Welcome, alike what has been, and what never was, and what we hope may be, to your shelter underneath the holly, to your places 'round the Christmas fire, where what is sits open-hearted! In yonder shadow, do we see obtruding furtively upon the blaze, an enemy's face? By Christmas Day we do forgive him! If the injury he has done us may admit of such companionship, let him come here and take his place. If otherwise, unhappily, let him go hence, assured that we will never injure nor accuse him.
</p>
<p>
On this day, we shut out Nothing!
</p>
<p>
"Pause," says a low voice. "Nothing? Think!"
</p>
<p>
"On Christmas Day, we will shut out from our fireside, Nothing."
</p>
<p>
"Not the shadow of a vast City where the withered leaves are lying deep?" the voice replies. "Not the shadow that darkens the whole globe? Not the shadow of the City of the Dead?"
</p>
<p>
Not even that. Of all days in the year, we will turn our faces towards that City upon Christmas Day, and from its silent hosts bring those we loved, among us. City of the Dead, in the blessed name wherein we are gathered together at this time, and in the Presence that is here among us according to the promise, we will receive, and not dismiss, thy people who are dear to us!
</p>
<p>
Yes. We can look upon these children angels that alight, so solemnly, so beautifully, among the living children by the fire, and can bear to think how they departed from us. Entertaining angels unawares, as the Patriarchs did, the playful children are unconscious of their guests; but we can see them--can see a radiant arm around one favorite neck, as if there were a tempting of that child away. Among the celestial figures there is one, a poor mis-shapen boy on earth, of a glorious beauty now, of whom his dying mother said it grieved her much to leave him here, alone, for so many years as it was likely would elapse before he came to her--being such a little child. But he went quickly, and was laid upon her breast, and in her hand she leads him.
</p>
<p>
There was a gallant boy, who fell, far away, upon a burning sand beneath a burning sun, and said, "Tell them at home, with my last love, how much I could have wished to kiss them once, but that I died contented and had done my duty!" Or there was another, over whom they read the words, "Therefore we commit his body to the dark!" and so consigned him to the lonely ocean and sailed on. Or there was another who lay down to his rest in the dark shadow of great forests, and, on earth, awoke no more. O shall they not, from sand and sea and forest, be brought home at such a time!
</p>
<p>
There was a dear girl--almost a woman--never to be one--who made a mourning Christmas in a house of joy, and went her trackless way to the silent City. Do we recollect her, worn out, faintly whispering what could not be heard, and falling into that last sleep for weariness? O look upon her now! O look upon her beauty, her serenity, her changeless youth, her happiness! The daughter of Jairus was recalled to life, to die; but she, more blest, has heard the same voice, saying unto her, "Arise for ever!"
</p>
<p>
We had a friend who was our friend from early days, with whom we often pictured the changes that were to come upon our lives, and merrily imagined how we would speak, and walk, and think, and talk, when we came to be old. His destined habitation in the City of the Dead received him in his prime. Shall he be shut out from our Christmas remembrance? Would his love have so excluded us? Lost friend, lost child, lost parent, sister, brother, husband, wife, we will not so discard you! You shall hold your cherished places in our Christmas hearts, and by our Christmas fires; and in the season of immortal hope, and on the birthday of immortal mercy, we will shut out Nothing!
</p>
<p>
The winter sun goes down over town and village; on the sea it makes a rosy path, as if the Sacred tread were fresh upon the water. A few more moments, and it sinks, and night comes on, and lights begin to sparkle in the prospect. On the hill-side beyond the shapelessly-diffused town, and in the quiet keeping of the trees that gird the village-steeple, remembrances are cut in stone, planted in common flowers, growing in grass, entwined with lowly brambles around many a mound of earth. In town and village, there are doors and windows closed against the weather, there are flaming logs heaped high, there are joyful faces, there is healthy music of voices. Be all ungentleness and harm excluded from the temples of the Household Gods, but be those remembrances admitted with tender encouragement! They are of the time and all its comforting and peaceful reassurances; and of the history that reunited even upon earth the living and the dead; and of the broad beneficence and goodness that too many men have tried to tear to narrow shreds.

<chapter>
<title>WHAT CHRISTMAS IS TO A BUNCH OF PEOPLE.</title>
<p>
<sc>The Father of a Family</sc> rubs his hands with a genial smile when Christmas comes; and yet he now and then raises one finger to the calculating "organ" of his cranium with rather a thoughtful air, suggestive of certain bills and taxes, which he is resolved shall not weigh upon his mind. Why should they? He will get through his Christmas bills somehow or other, as he has done before. He has no doubt of being able to muster the money to "article" his eldest son to a highly respectable solicitor; he has already laid up a small portion for his eldest daughter, and makes pretty sure of doing as much for the others by the time they are old enough to be married. He has a good business; his wife is a clever manager; they live happily together; the holly-berries smile at him with the well-remembered sparkle of early days; he therefore determines to enjoy the merry season as of old. What if he does see half-a-dozen more grey hairs displaying themselves, as though to remind him that another year has passed, and a certain line or two in his face does look a trifle deeper than when he had last observed it? What have such small matters to do with the real age of a man? A man is as old as he feels, and no more. The fact is, the Father of a Family is as young as he was twenty years ago; so he gives his hair an additional and rather flourishing touch with a comb, puts on a new waistcoat, brushes the collar of his coat, and, looking down with complacency on his boots as he sets his hat lightly upon his head, sallies out upon the landing-place, and shouts a jaunty inquiry as to when his wife and daughter will be ready to go to church. The boys are gone on before. Meanwhile he stands thrumming a pleased, but impatient, tattoo with his fingers upon the banisters, and inhaling every now and then a savoury whiff of sweet herbs rising up from the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
<sc>The Mother of a Family</sc> has a world of anxious thoughts about her. She likes Christmas; it is, no doubt, a pleasant time; there are many sweet memories and hopes attending it, and altogether it must be considered as happy: but the butcher's bill, she knows, must be heavy--the baker's too--and as for the grocer's, she is almost afraid to think of it. Besides this, there is a new dress-maker's bill, which she has not yet told Mr. Broadback about. But how was all this to be avoided?
</p>
<p>
As to herself, she could not do with less, nor her eldest daughter, especially on the eve of her marriage--a happy marriage she most devoutly hopes it will be. Then there are the growing girls, all of whose dresses have got so shockingly short, that she could almost wish the follies of Bloomerism had been softened and translated, and entered England under another character--as a Persian, Turkish, or Polish ladies' "fashions," just imported from Paris--so that something economically elegant might have gradually been introduced, inch by inch, as it were, to the great saving of the Mothers of large families of daughters. As for the bonnet-maker, she must wait. It is unknown what sums have been paid that bonnet-maker in the course of the last six years. Perhaps it would be best not to think any more of these matters just at present. At any rate, Mr. Broadback shall have a good Christmas dinner; she will take care of that; and all their relations and friends who are invited shall be made as happy as possible.
</p>
<p>
<sc>The Eldest Son</sc> has a mixed feeling about Christmas. He has no very romantic impressions of the study of the Law; but he wishes to begin life, and to take the first step towards making his way in the world; and as he is to be articled to Mr. Benjamin Sheepskin early in January, he looks upon the intermediate time rather impatiently. At least he would do so, but that his cousin Ellen is to dine with them on Christmas-day, and stay on a visit for a week afterwards, during which there will be round games and forfeits, and he will "go partners" with his cousin, and dance with her, and show her all his law-books, and decoy her under the mistletoe-bough; and so he expects to pass a very merry time before he goes to the office of Mr. Sheepskin.
</p>
<p>
What Christmas is to <sc>the Eldest Daughter</sc>, we may pretty well infer from the increased brightness in her eyes, the frequent blush that suffuses her soft cheeks, the occasional pensive air suddenly awakening up with a smile, the tender sigh, and the additional pains she takes with her beautiful hair, which is never out of order, and yet she thinks it continually needs to be brushed and smoothed, and set to rights. To her, Christmas evidently comes with a wedding-ring concealed in a wreath of evergreen.
</p>
<p>
Besides the eldest son, there are "<sc>the Boys</sc>;" and these rollicking young chaps are home for the holidays; and Christmas to them is (weather permitting) an endless succession of sliding and snow-balls, and hoops, and going on the ice; and plum-puddings, and mince-pies, and games at blind-man's-buff, and other romps in the evening, with snap-dragon after supper.
</p>
<p>
To <sc>the Youngest Child</sc> a little bright-eyed fairy of five years old, in a white and sky-blue frock, purple sash, and red shoes Christmas is a season of romance. It is a whirl of shining hours, in which there are new toys of mysterious beauty, and dances, and kisses, and cakes of all sorts, and sweet-meats, and wonderful things made of painted sugar, and all the creatures of the earth, with Noah's Ark in the middle, and brothers and sisters, and playmates, the eldest of whom is not yet "gone eight"--spoken of, like a little clock!--and Mamma in a new dress, shining with bracelets, and a chain and things; and dear Auntie with a busy face making something nice to eat; and loud shouting and crowding round a Christmas tree, all of green and gold, with lights; and glittering presents of priceless value dangling from every twig, and hidden in deep green recesses of the boughs. This is the true Fairy-land we have all read so much about!
</p>
<p>
But <sc>the Maiden Aunt</sc>, she who so continually sits on one side, out of the way, or in the quiet shade of a corner she who is so continually forgotten, except when some kind assistance is needed shall we, too, forget her? Far from it. We well know what Christmas is to her. All her life is devoted to amiable disinterested acts of practical aid to all in the house who need it; and the period of Christmas, to her, is the summing up of a year's account of sympathies and kindly offices, of which she herself takes no note beyond the moment, and which have no place in her memory except to cause a sigh of regret when any gentle service has not effected all the good she intended.
</p>
<p>
What Christmas is to <sc>the old House-keeper</sc> of a substantial family, more wealthy than the one just described, we must all see at once to be a very serious business indeed;--complicated, and full of grave cares, packages of hope, close-covered preparations, and spicy responsibilities. There she stands, with her tortoise-shell spectacles, and a great bunch of keys dangling over her white apron! No minister of State thinks more of herself (Heaven forgive us!--himself) than this old lady does. Her "linen closet" is a model of neatness and order; her "china closet" is set out with the utmost precision, and not without an eye to effect in the prominent display on the highest shelves of the choice old china-bowls, basins, tea-cups, saucers, and an immensely ancient tea-pot of the ugliest shape imaginable, and covered with very ugly faded paintings, of great value. But most of all is her pride and importance in the house, and in her own self-esteem, displayed when she unlocks and opens the door of her "store-room." No one must enter but the Housekeeper herself. You may stand outside, and lean round the sides of the open door, and peep in but no more. There, you see large tea-canisters of different sizes--and coffee-canisters--and dark slate-blue paper bags--and polished wooden spice-boxes, tall, and round, and unscrewing in several places--and boxes of raisins, and a fig-drum, and many packets of different sizes, with a large white cone of loaf-sugar standing in the midst--(we think the Youngest Child of this family really must be allowed to come in, and look about, but not touch anything)--and light bundles of dry herbs hanging from nails, and small baskets attached to hooks, and half a German sausage, besides three Bath chaps swinging by short strings from nails on the edge of the top shelf; while, ranged along the shelves, the Child sees a beautiful array of white jam-pots and preserve pots, and brown pickle jars, and wide-necked glass bottles full of deep-coloured cherries, and preserved gooseberries, plums, apricots, and other fruits--with honey-jars, and tamarind-jars; and beneath each shelf, a range of drawers with brass handles, labelled outside with the names of all the nicest, and some of the most mysterious, things, in the eatable world.
</p>
<p>
What this period of the year is to <sc>the Gardener</sc>, we may easily guess, from great arms-full of mistletoe boughs, of holly-boughs thick with berries, and of branches of laurel which he is continually carrying into the house, or going with as a present to neighbouring houses. And now, see him coming along with a bending back, bearing an entire fir-tree, which gracefully nods its head as he slowly trudges along, and shakes and rustles all its dry brown cones, as if in dumb anticipation of the peals of bells that will shortly be rung! This fir is for the Christmas Tree--the green and simple foundation and super-structure, which is shortly destined to sustain so much brightness and romance, so many glittering presents, and to be the medium of so many sweet feelings, joyous hopes, and tender sense of childhood--in present bright visions around us, and in tender recollections of the past.
</p>
<p>
As for <sc>the Nurse</sc>, there can be no doubt but Christmas is a very anxious time for her. She expects so many of the young folks will make themselves very ill with all this quantity of plum-pudding, and plum-cake, and mince-pies. However, she consoles herself, on the whole, for any extra trouble she may have in pouring out, or mixing and stirring wine-glasses of physic, and trying to conceal powders in honey or red-currant jelly (and then getting them down!) by the proud recollection that she had the lady of the house in her arms when a child; and this consciousness makes her feel of the highest importance in the family.
</p>
<p>
But <sc>the Doctor</sc>--the medical attendant of the family--there are no mixed feelings or misgivings in his mind. He hears of all the preparations--all the nice things--and shakes his head gravely at the lady of the house; but the instant he is outside the door, he hurries homeward, rubbing his knuckles. <em>He</em> knows!
</p>
<p>
The black coat of <sc>the Vicar</sc> has a richer and more prominent tone of black, as he walks across the broad snow of his seven-acre field, towards the stile that leads into the lane that runs to the vestry-door of the church. The snow-covered hedges, with frosted twigs at top, nod and glisten to him as he moves briskly onward, pointing his Church-and-stately black toe along the narrow path, beside the deep cart-rut, with its rough, and jagged ridges. Christmas to him is a series of dinners, and "offerings," and good things, and compliments, and wedding fees, and burial fees, and christening fees, and charity sermons, exhorting the rich to remember the poor, and exhorting the poor to be meek and contented, and trust to Providence. Meantime, <sc>the Curate</sc> goes to tea-parties, and has a great deal to do in the details of Church business affairs, as the vestries are often very troublesome; and has much to do in visiting the sick, and administering religious consolation, and riding on horseback to do double duty--morning service, here--afternoon, there--evening service, here again, or somewhere else. This is the ordinary, regular, hard-working, useful Curate; but if he be a spruce young Puseyite Curate, in a black silk sacerdotal dress-waistcoat, with a narrow, stiff white neck-tie, and a black superfine frock-coat, cut to the quick--then, he very often rivals the Vicar in his dinner-parties, and gives him the "go-by" in evening-parties, where he clean carries off most of the young ladies for a little intense talk of divine things, in one corner of the room.
</p>
<p>
If Christmas be a great fact to <sc>the Beadle</sc>, the Beadle seems a greater fact to Christmas. New broad-cloth--new scarlet and gold--new gold-laced cocked hat, of old Lord Mayor fashion--new gold-headed cane--no wonder that all the little charity boys eye his inflated presence with additional awe! No wonder that it is inflated; for he is swollen with the substantial comforts derived from all the great kitchens in the neighbourhood. There is a roasted ox in his mind. He can never forget the year when one was roasted whole upon the ice, and he present, and allowed to take his turn with the basting-ladle. It was the epic event of his life.
</p>
<p>
The Beadle is generally able to frown the charity boys into awe and silence; assisting the said frown, every now and then, with a few cuts of a long yellow twining cane, during service; whereby, amidst the sonorous tones of the preacher, there often breaks out a squealing cry from the hollow and remote aisles, or distant rows of heads in the organ loft, to the great injury of the eloquence of the pastor, and the gravity of the junior portion of his congregation.
</p>
<p>
But though this parish Terror of the Poor has portentous frowns for most of those under his dominion, he knows how to patronise with a smile, and his rubicund beams, at all seasons of festival, and more especially at Christmas, fall encouragingly upon all the cooks of the best houses round about. Perhaps, upon the chief Bell-ringer perhaps, we may say, upon all the bell-ringers and now and then upon the Sexton, with whom he does a little private business, in the way of gratuities from mourning relatives who come to visit graves. But as for the Pew-opener, envy of her gains at Christmas, and her obduracy in concealing their extent, renders him a foe to her existence, and haughtily unconscious of her presence as often as he can affect not to see her. There was, once upon a time, a good Beadle, who married a Pew-opener--but it was a long while ago--so long, that it is thought to have been in the good old--&amp;c.
</p>
<p>
Christmas is not what it was to the <sc>Post-man</sc>. The Government has interfered sadly with his collection of "boxes" from house to house; so that now he only receives gratefully a shilling, here and there, in streets where formerly he had but to announce, after a loud double-rap, that "the Postman has called for his Christmas-box!" and down came the shilling, almost as a lawful right. He looks melancholy as he sits on the bench outside a country public-house; and when the Landlord inquires the cause, he hints at the altered times. But he does not get much sympathy in this quarter; for <sc>the Publican</sc> feels that the alteration is considerably in his favour. He has had a new beer-machine for his bar, all beautiful with inlaid brass and ivory; he has added a wing to his house, and he feels a proud consciousness that, if all his town relations live in "palaces," he is quite as important to the sinners, his subjects, in the country.
</p>
<p>
To the <sc>Cattle-drover</sc> this is a season of arduous business, by day and by night, urging his fatigued and often refractory beasts along the dark roads; arid when they enter among the many lights and glare of London, as they sometimes do in the evening, what Christmas is to the poor cattle, as well as the men, may be conjectured; and all things considered, one may fairly say the oxen have the worst of it. <sc>The Shepherd</sc> who is driving a flock of sheep to the Christmas market, seldom sees much amusement by the way; events with him are rare; but the journey of the <sc>Pig-drovers</sc> up to town is always a "chequered" history. One pig or another is sure to be of an original turn of mind, and several are sure to follow his example for a little while, and then branch off into a line of conduct suited exclusively to their own individuality: under cart-wheels, dodging round pumps, hiding noses behind tree-trunks in the country, and behind theatrical boards in the front of town shops; rushing into hedges, and round haystacks, as the drove moves unwillingly along lanes and roads; and into wine-cellars, and round lamp-posts, and up "all manner of streets" in London. <sc>The Turkey-drover</sc> has also a very busy time of it just now; and the <sc>Goose-drover</sc> far more. The greater difficulty attending the flocks of geese is not because they are so much more numerous than the turkeys, as on account of the perverse, irritable, and stupid conditions of mind which alternate with the goose. It is to be remembered that the warlike turkey-cock (so aptly called in Scotland the bubbly-jock) and the mature fierce-necked, wing-threatening, universally-assaulting gander, being preserved by their toughness, are not present in these festive processions. We speak only of the young and middle-aged turkey and goose; but while we give the degree of difficulty in their safe-conduct very much to the side of the latter, we are almost disposed to agree with the eminent poet, who has sung its praises in another sense, finely combining with that praise a kind of hint at a moral justification for its death:
</p>
<poem>
<poem1>"Of all the fowls that stock the farm,</poem1>
<poem2>The Goose must be preferred;</poem2>
<poem1>There is so much of nutriment</poem1>
<poem2>In that weak-minded bird."</poem2>
</poem>
<p>
Christmas to <sc>the Butcher</sc> is nothing less than a bazaar of fine meat, displayed with all the elegancies (they are not numerous) of which his craft is susceptible. With a smiling countenance and ruddy cheek he walks backwards and forwards, through his shop all hung with choice specimens of last year's "grass "--the sun gleaming across them by day, and the gas shining at night upon the polished surfaces, and delicate white fat, and sparkling amidst the branches of holly, stuck about in all directions. He very much approves of the vigorous way in which one of his men continues to bawl in a sharp quick tone "now then, t' buy! t' buy!" when the most unlikely people, or when no people at all, are passing. It all looks like business and bustle.
</p>
<p>
<sc>The Baker</sc> stands amidst his walls of loaves, built up, shelf upon shelf,--with other shelves packed close with quartern and half-quartern paper-bags of flour,--and he glances from the topmost tier down to the flour-whitened trap-door in one corner of his shop-floor, wherefrom appears an ascending tray, heaped up with long French rolls, cottage-loaves, twists, rusks, and hot-spiced gingerbread-nuts. This loaded tray continues to rise upon a man's head, which is gradually followed by his body, and the whole structure approaching the counter is speedily unloaded. In less than half an hour, all that was thus brought from below has disappeared; the walls of loaves have diminished in great gaps; more loaves come smoking in, to supply their places, and more trays of rolls, twists, gingerbread-nuts, and fancy bread, with piles of biscuits, ascend through the trap-door. The Baker has a nice-looking daughter (as most bakers in England have), and she now comes in smiling, and displaying a row of pearly teeth, and assists in taking money. They both agree that although summer has its advantages, there is no time of the year so pleasant as Christmas.
</p>
<p>
<sc>The Grocer</sc> is one of the most flourishing men in all the world at this season. His shop is a small and over-crowded epitome of the produce of the East. He is evidently in constant correspondence with China, has the most "friendly relations" in India, is on familial-terms with the Spice Islands, has confidential friends in Egypt, Barbary, and on "Candy's shore;" while, as to Jamaica, and other West India Islands, he has a box, a cask, or a case, by every post, to say nothing of Arabia, France, Greece, Spain, Italy, and, in fine, all the trading ports of the Mediterranean Sea. To the Grocer we may fairly say that Christmas is a general shaking by the hand, with fingers extremely sticky, of foreign relations and agents in every country, whence something good to eat, in the shape of dried fruits, spices, teas, coffees, sugars, preserves and condiments, are possible to be procured. If he has a newly-arrived Chinese picture, inlaid caddy, monster idol, or tea-pot, now is his time to make a feature of it in his window!
</p>
<p>
<sc>The Green-grocer</sc> is a genuine Englishman; he cannot boast of the foreign commodities of the tea-and-sugar mountebank over the way. He has no wish to do it. He deals entirely in home produce. All that he sells, is the natural result of the cultivation, of the soil of his native country: from celery, beetroot, sea-kale, and cabbage-sprouts, to Jerusalem artichokes and sage and onions. All of English growth! He could very easily hollow out a turnip; cut eyes, nose, and mouth in it; stick a bit of candle inside; and then set it up for a "show," all among the endive and parsley, in the middle of his window on Christmas Eve; but he scorns all such attempts to attract public attention. It may be very well for the Grocer over the way; but that sort of thing won't do for a man who deals in natural greens!
</p>
<p>
Christmas, to <sc>the Pastrycook</sc>, is the season when the human mind, if well regulated, is chiefly occupied in the contemplation of mince-pies. Also in eating them, and decidedly in paying for them. But a very large consumption of holiday plum-cakes is not the less expected by the patriotic pastrycook. There is another yet greater event in his mind, though he does not break ground with this till after Christmas Day; and that is, the advance of Twelfth Night. While, therefore, he expects the public to be solely occupied with mince-pies and other seasonable matters, he is secretly at work in the production of a full set (we forget how many he told us made a set) of the richest and most elaborately decorated and "dramatised" Twelfth Cakes which the juvenile world of England has ever yet beheld. The man's half crazy. His wife says he gets no sleep with thinking of his cakes. The other night he started up in bed, and cried out '"Sugar-frost and whitening!" till his night-cap stood on end. Though why on earth--as the good lady remarked, on second thoughts, "he should talk of whitening, she couldn't form the remotest idea in life!"
</p>
<p>
No doubt Christmas is the season which calls forth the most unmitigated hatred of poachers in the breast of the patriotic <sc>Poulterer</sc>. He says they are pests of society, and the wickedest men going. There is no excuse for strong fellows leading an idle life, as most of the poachers do. It is worse than idle; he calls it thievish and villanous. He would be the last man in all England to encourage such doings. On the contrary, he would show them no mercy. Every man-jack of them that could be caught, he would send for two or three days to hard work on Primrose Hill. After this they would become better and wiser men; more industrious, more cautious; not so full of talk in beer-houses; more punctual and reliable; altogether more useful members of society. But as for his show of hares and other game, this Christmas, he will warrant every one, as having been honestly come by, and duly paid for, and not too "high" for immediate eating. What a capital show he makes this year! One hundred and twenty long-legs (as he familiarly calls the hares), three hundred rabbits, fifty brace of pheasants, ninety brace of "birds," twenty brace of woodcocks, thirty brace of snipe, a hundred and fifty brace of pigeons, two hundred turkeys, three hundred geese, with wild ducks, tame ducks, and barn-door fowls innumerable! The inside of his shop is full in every corner; from countless hooks, hang rows of turkeys by the necks, and long double chains of sausages and rows of ducks, and rows of fowls, all dangling by the necks, too, and in full feather; while his shelves present compact arrays of fowls plucked and trussed, and powdered, and blown up in the breast with a blow-pipe: their livers and gizzards tucked neatly, like opera-hats, under their pinions. Rows of them, also, like small batteries, front the street. The outside of his house, even up to the second floor window, is hung with hares, rabbits, pheasants, wild-ducks, turkeys, and partridges.
</p>
<p>
But, if Christmas is a season of greatness to some, of hilarity to many, of importance to all, it is pre-eminently a season of equal anxiety and splendour to <sc>the Cook</sc>, Her long kitchen-range is a perfect bonfire, from morning to night, while the various bright utensils which are placed upon the chimney-piece and on the walls at both sides of it, are profusely interspersed with twigs and boughs of holly. "Now, do get out of my way, all of you! don't you see how much I have got on my mind with this Christmas dinner! Where's Jane?--Jane Stokes!--oh, the plague of kitchen-maids! they're always out of the way at the moment they're most wanted. Barbara, are the vegetables washed?" "Not yet, Cook!" It's always "not yet" with them scullery-girls! Oh, how the Cook wishes there were no need for any help from any soul alive, if so be as she could but do everything herself, which is that is where it is and all about it! But the Christmas dinner don't get spoiled; by no means--everything turns out excellently, and compliments, like full-blown cabbage-roses, are showered upon Cook from the visitors of the hospitable board. They are brought to her, as she sits wiping her fore-head, and all her face and throat, in a cool and remote corner. Her heart expands; she loves all mankind; and she retires to rest, after a small glass of cordial, at peace with herself and all the world.

<title>WHAT CHRISTMAS IS IN COUNTRY PLACES.</title>
<p>
IF we want to see the good old Christmas--the traditional Christmas--of old England, we must look for it in the country. There are lasting reasons why the keeping of Christinas cannot change in the country as it may in towns. The seasons themselves ordain the festival. The close of the year is an interval of leisure in agricultural regions; the only interval of complete leisure in the year; and all influences and opportunities concur to make it a season of holiday and festivity. If the weather is what it ought to be at that time, the autumn crops are in the ground; and the springing wheat is safely covered up with snow. Everything is done for the soil that can be done at present; and as for the clearing and trimming and repairing, all that can be looked to in the after part of the winter; and the planting is safe if done before Candlemas. The plashing of hedges, and cleaning of ditches, and trimming of lanes, and mending of roads, can be got through between Twelfth Night and the early spring ploughing; and a fortnight may well be given to jollity, and complete change.
</p>
<p>
Such a holiday requires a good deal of preparation: so Christmas is, in this way also, a more weighty affair in the rural districts than elsewhere. The strong beer must be brewed. The pigs must be killed weeks before; the lard is wanted; the bacon has to be cured; the hams will be in request; and, if brawn is sent to the towns, it must be ready before the children come home for the holidays. Then, there is the fattening of the turkeys and geese to be attended to; a score or two of them to be sent to London, and perhaps half-a-dozen to be enjoyed at home. When the gentleman, or the farmer, or the country shop-keeper, goes to the great town for his happy boys and girls, he has a good deal of shopping to do. Besides carrying a note to the haberdasher, and ordering coffee, tea, dried fruit, and spices, he must remember not to forget the packs of cards that will be wanted for loo and whist. Perhaps he carries a secret order for fiddlestrings from a neighbour who is practising his part in good time.
</p>
<p>
There is one order of persons in the country to whom the month of December is any thing but a holiday season--the cooks. Don't tell us of town-cooks in the same breath! It is really overpowering to the mind to think what the country cooks have to attend to. The goose-pie, alone, is an achievement to be complacent about; even the most ordinary goose-pie; still more, a superior one, with a whole goose in the middle, and another cut up and laid round; with a fowl or two, and a pheasant or two, and a few larks put into odd corners; and the top, all shiny with white of egg, ligured over with leaves of pastry, and tendrils and crinkle-crankles, with a bunch of the more delicate bird feet standing up in the middle. The oven is the cook's child and slave; the great concern of her life, at this season. She pets it, she humours it, she scolds it, and she works it without rest. Before daylight she is at it--baking her oat bread; that bread which requires such perfect behaviour on the part of the oven! Long lines of oat-cakes hang overhead, to grow crisp before breakfast; and these are to be put away when crisp, to make room for others; for she can hardly make too much. After breakfast, and all day, she is making and baking meat-pies, mince-pies, sausage-rolls, fruit-pies, and cakes of all shapes, sizes, and colours. And at night, when she can scarcely stand for fatigue, she "banks" the oven fire, and puts in the great jar of stock for the soups, that the drawing may go on, from all sorts of savoury odds and ends, while everything but the drowsy fire is asleep. She wishes the dear little lasses would not come messing and fussing about, making ginger-bread and cheesecakes. She would rather do it herself, than have them in her way. But she has not the heart to tell them so. On the contrary, she gives them ginger, and cuts the citron-peel bountifully for them; hoping, the while, that the weather will be fine enough for them to go into the woods with their brothers for holly and ivy. Meantime, the dairy-woman says, (what she declares every Christmas,) that she never saw such a demand for cream and butter; and that, before Twelfth Night, there will be none. And how, at that season, can she supply eggs by scores, as she is expected to do? The gingerbread baked, the rosiest-apples picked out from their straw in the apple-closet, the cats, and dogs, and canary birds, played with and fed, the little lasses run out to see what the boys are about.
</p>
<p>
The woodmen want something else than green to dress the house with. They are looking for the thickest, and hardest, and knottiest block of wood they can find, that will go into the kitchen chimney. A gnarled stump of elm will serve their purpose best; and they trim it into a size to send home. They fancy that their holiday is to last as long as this log remains; and they are satisfied that it will be uncommonly difficult to burn up this one. This done, one of them proceeds with the boys and girls to the copses where the hollies are thickest; and by carrying his bill-hook, he saves a vast deal of destruction by rending and tearing. The poor little birds, which make the hollies so many aviaries in winter, coming to feed on the berries, and to pop in among the shining leaves for shelter, are sadly scared, and out they flit on all sides, and away to the great oak, where nobody will follow them. For, alas! there is no real mistletoe now. There is to be something so called hung from the middle of the kitchen ceiling, that the lads and lasses may snatch kisses and have their fun; but it will have no white berries, and no Druidical dignity about it. It will be merely a bush of evergreen, called by some a mistletoe, and by others the Bob, which is supposed to be a corruption of "bough." When all the party have got their fagots tied up, and strung over their shoulders, and button-holes, hats, and bonnets stuck with sprigs, and gay with berries, it is time they were going home; for there is a vast deal to be done this Christmas Eve, and the sunshine is already between the hills, in soft yellow gushes, and not on them.
</p>
<p>
A vast deal there is to be done; and especially if there is any village near. First, there is to dress the house with green; and then to go and help to adorn the church. The Bob must not be hung up till to-morrow: but every door has a branch over it; and the leads of the latticed windows are stuck with sprigs; and every picture-frame, and looking-glass, and candlestick is garnished. Any "scraps" (very young children) who are too small to help, pick up scattered holly-leaves, and, being not allowed to go upon the rug, beg somebody to throw them into the fire; whence ensues a series of cracklings, and sputtering blazes, and lighting up of wide-open eyes. In the midst of this--hark! is not that the church bell? The boys go out to listen, and report that it is so;--the "Christmas deal" (or dole) is about to begin; so, off go all who are able, up to the church.
</p>
<p>
It is very cold there, and dim, and dreary, in spite of the candles, and the kindness, and other good things that are collected there. By the time the bell has ceased to clang, there are a few gentlemen there, and a number of widows, and aged men, and orphan children. There are piles of blankets; and bits of paper, which are orders for coals. One gentleman has sent a bag of silver money; and another, two or three sheep, cut up ready for cooking; and another, a great pile of loaves. The boys run and bring down a ladder to dress the pillars; and scuffle in the galleries; and venture into the pulpit, under pretence of dressing the church. When the dole is done and the poor people gone, the doors are closed; and, if the boys remain, they must be quiet; for the organist and the singers are going to rehearse the anthem that is to be sung to-morrow. If the boys are not quiet, they are turned out.
</p>
<p>
There is plenty of bustle in the village. The magistrates are in the long room of the inn, settling justice business. The inn looks as if it were illuminated. The waiters are seen to glide across the hall; and on the steps are the old constable, and the new rural policeman, and the tax-collector, and the postman. It is so cold that something steaming hot will soon be brought for them to drink; and the poor postman will be taken on his weak side. Christmas is a trying season to him, with his weak head, and his popularity, and his Christmas-boxes, and his constant liability to be reported. Cold as it is, there are women flitting about; or from the grocer's shop, and all bringing away the same things. The grocers give away, this night, to their regular customers, a good mould candle each, and a nutmeg. This is because the women must be up by candle-light to-morrow, to make something that is to be spiced with nutmeg. So a good number of women pass by with a candle and a nutmeg; and some, with a bottle or pitcher, come up the steps, and go to the bar for some rum. But the clock strikes supper-time, and away go the boys home.
</p>
<p>
Somebody wonders at supper whether the true oval mince-pie is really meant to be in the form of a certain manger; and its contents to signify the gifts, various and rich, brought by the Magi to that manger. And while the little ones are staring at this news, somebody else observes that it was a pretty idea of the old pagans, in our island, of dressing up their houses with ever-greens, that there might be a warm retreat for the spirits of the woods in times of frost and bitter winter storms. Some child peeps timidly up at the biggest branch in the room, and fancies what it would be to see some sprite sitting under a leaf, or dancing along a spray. When supper is done, and the youngest are gone to bed, having been told not to be surprised if they should hear the stars singing in the night, the rest of the party turn to the fire, and begin to roast their chestnuts in the shovel, and to heat the elder-wine in the old-fashioned saucepan, silvered inside. One absent boy, staring at the fire, starts when his father offers him a chestnut for his thoughts. He hesitates, but his curiosity is vivid, and he braves all the consequences of saying what he is thinking about. He wonders whether he might, just for once,--just for this once--go to the stalls when midnight has struck, and see whether the oxen are kneeling. He has heard, and perhaps read, that the oxen kneeled, on the first Christmas-day, and kept the manger warm with their breath; and that all oxen still kneel in their stalls when Christmas-day comes in. Father and mother exchange a quick glance of agreement to take this seriously; and they explain that there is now so much uncertainty, since the New Style of reckoning the days of the year was introduced, that the oxen cannot be depended on; and it is not worth while to be out of bed at midnight for the chance. Some say the oxen kneel punctually when Old Christmas comes in; and if so, they will not do it to-night.
</p>
<p>
This is not the quietest night of the year; even if nobody visits the oxen. Soon after all are settled to sleep, sounds arise which thrill through some who are half-awakened by them, and then, remembering something about the stars singing, the children rouse themselves, and lie, with open eyes and feeling that Christmas morning has come. They must soon, one would think, give up the star theory; for the music is only two fiddles, or a fiddle and clarionet; or, possibly, a fiddle and drum, with a voice or two, which can hardly be likened to that of the spheres. The voices sing, "While shepherds watch'd their flocks by night;" and then--marvellously enough--single out this family of all the families on the earth, to bless with the good wishes of the season. They certainly are wishing to master and mistress and all the young ladies and gentlemen, "good morning," and "a merry Christmas and a happy New Year." Before this celestial mystery is solved, and before the distant twang of the fiddle is quite out of hearing, the celestial mystery of sleep enwraps the other, and lays it to rest until the morrow. The boys--the elder ones--meant to keep awake; first, for the Waits, and afterwards to determine for themselves whether the cock crows all night on Christmas Eve, to keep all hurtful things from walking the earth. When the Waits are gone, they just remember that any night, between this and Old Christmas, will do for the cock, which is said to defy evil spirits in this manner for the whole of that season. Which the boys are very glad to remember; for they are excessively sleepy; so off they go into the land of dreams.
</p>
<p>
It is now past two; and at three the maids must be up. Christmas morning is the one, of all the year, when, in the North of England especially, families make a point of meeting, and it must be at the breakfast table. In every house, far and near, where there is fuel and flour, and a few pence to buy currants, there are cakes making, which everybody must eat of; cakes of pastry, with currants between the layers. The grocer has given the nutmeg; and those who can afford it, add rum, and other dainties. The ladies are up betimes, to iet out the best candlesticks, to garnish the table, to make the coffee, and to prepare a welcome for all who claim a seat. The infant in arms must be there, as seven o'clock strikes. Any married brother or sister, living within reach, must be there, with the whole family train. Long before sunrise, there they sit, in the glow of the fire and the glitter of candles, chatting and laughing, and exchanging good wishes.
</p>
<p>
In due time, the church-bell calls the flock of worshippers from over hill, and down dale, and along commons, and across fields: and presently they are seen coming, all in their best,--the majority probably saying the same thing,--that, somehow, it seems always to be fine on Christmas-day. Then, one may reckon up the exceptions he remembers; and another may tell of different sorts of fine weather that he has known; how, on one occasion, his daughter gathered thirty-four sorts of flowers in their own garden on Christmas-day; and the rose-bushes had not lost their leaves on Twelfth Day; and then the wise will agree how much they prefer a good seasonable frost and sheeted snow like this, to April weather in December.
</p>
<p>
Service over, the bell silent, and the sexton turning the key in the lock, off run the young men, out of reach of remonstrance, to shoot, until dinner at least,--more probably until the light fails. They shoot almost any thing that comes across them, but especially little birds, chaffinches, blackbirds, thrushes,--any winged creature distressed by the cold, or betrayed by the smooth and cruel snow. The little children at home are doing better than their elder brothers. They are putting out crums of bread for the robins, and feeling sorry and surprised that robins prefer bread to plum-pudding. They would have given the robins some of their own pudding, if they had but liked it.
</p>
<p>
In every house, there is dinner to-day,--of one sort or another,--except where the closed shutter shows that the folk are out to dinner. The commonest dinner in the poorer houses--in some parts of the country--is a curious sort of mutton pie. The meat is cut off a loin of mutton, and reduced to mouthfuls, and then strewed over with currants or raisins and spice, and the whole covered in with a stout crust. In some places, the dinner is baked meat and potatoes: in too many cottages, there is nothing better than a morsel of bacon to flavour the bread or potatoes. But it may be safely said that there is more and better dining in England on Christinas-day than on any other day of the year.
</p>
<p>
In the houses of gentry and farmers, the dinner and dessert are a long affair, and soon followed by tea, that the sports may begin. Everybody knows what these sports are, in parlour, hall, and kitchen:--singing, dancing, cards, blind-man's buff, and other such games; forfeits, ghost-story telling, snap-dragon;--these, with a bountiful supper interposed, lasting till midnight. In scattered houses, among the wilds, card-playing goes on briskly. Wherever there are Wesleyans enough to form a congregation, they are collected at a tea-drinking in their chapel; and they spend the evening in singing hymns. Where there are Germans settled, or any leading family which has been in Germany, there is a Christmas-tree lighted up somewhere. Those Christmas-trees are as prolific as the inexhaustible cedars of Lebanon. Wherever one strikes root, a great number is sure to spring up under its shelter.
</p>
<p>
However spent, the evening comes to an end. The hymns in the chapel, and the carols in the kitchen, and the piano in the parlour are all hushed. The ghosts have glided by into the night. The forfeits are redeemed. The blind-man has recovered his sight, and lost it again in sleep. The dust of the dancers has subsided. The fires are nearly out, and the candles quite so. The reflection that the great day is over, would have been too much for some little hearts, sighing before they slept, but for the thought that to-morrow is Boxing-day; and that Twelfth Night is yet to come.
</p>
<p>
But, first, will come New Year's Eve, with its singular inconvenience (in some districts) of nothing whatever being carried out of the house for twenty-four hours, lest, in throwing away anything, you should be throwing away some luck for the next year. Not a potato-paring, nor a drop of soap-suds or cabbage-water, not a cinder, nor a pinch of dust, must be removed till New Year's morning. In these places, there is one person who must be stirring early--the darkest man ill the neighbourhood. It is a serious thing there to have a swarthy complexion and black hair; for the owner cannot refuse to his acquaintance the good luck of his being the first to enter their houses on New Year's day. If he is poor, or his time is precious, he is regularly paid for his visit. He comes at day-break, with something in his hand, if it is only an orange or an egg, or a bit of ribbon, or a twopenny picture. He can't stay a minute,--he has so many to visit; but he leaves peace of mind behind him. His friends begin the year with the advantage of having seen a dark man enter their house the first in the New Year.
</p>
<p>
Such, in its general features, is Christmas, throughout the rural districts of Old England. Here, the revellers may be living in the midst of pastoral levels, all sheeted with snow; there, in deep lanes, or round a village green, with ploughed slopes rising on either hand: here, on the spurs of mountains, with glittering icicles hanging from the grey precipices above them, and the accustomed waterfall bound in silence by the frost beside their doors; and there again, they may be within hearing of the wintry surge, booming along the rocky shore; but the revelry is of much the same character everywhere. There may be one old superstition in one place, and another in another; but that which is no superstition is everywhere;--the hospitality, the mirth, the social glow which spreads from heart to heart, which thaws the pride and the purse-strings, and brightens the eyes and affections.

<title>WHAT CHRISTMAS IS IN THE COMPANY OF JOHN DOE.</title>
<p>
I HAVE kept (amongst a store of jovial, genial, heart-stirring returns of the season) some very dismal Christmases. I have kept Christmas in Constantinople, at a horrible Pera hotel, where I attempted the manufacture of a plum-pudding from the maccaroni-soup they served me for dinner, mingled with some Zante currants, and a box of figs I had brought from Smyrna; and where I sat, until very late at night, endeavouring to persuade myself that it was cold and "Christmassy" (though it wasn't), drinking Levant wine, and listening to the howling of the dogs outside, mingled with the clank of a portable fire-engine, which some soldiers were carrying to one of those extensive conflagrations which never happen in Constantinople oftener than three times a day. I have kept Christmas on board a Boulogne packet, in company with a basin, several despair-stricken females, and a damp steward; who, to all our inquiries whether we should be "in soon," had the one unvarying answer of "pretty near" to give. I have kept Christmas, when a boy, at a French boarding-school, where they gave me nothing but lentils and bouilli for dinner, on the auspicious day itself. I have kept Christmas by the bedside of a sick friend, and wished him the compliments of the season in his physic-bottles (had they contained another six months' life, poor soul!) I have kept Christmas at rich men's tables, where I have been uncomfortable; and once in a cobbler's shop, where I was excessively convivial. I have spent one Christmas in prison. Start not, urbane reader! I was not sent there for larceny, nor for misdemeanor: but for debt.
</p>
<p>
It was Christmas-eve; and I--my name is Prupper--was taking my walks abroad. I walked through the crowded Strand, elate, hilarious, benignant, for the feast was prepared, and the guests were bidden. Such a turkey I had ordered! Not the prize one with the ribbons--I mistrusted that; but a plump, tender, white-breasted bird, a king of turkeys. It was to be boiled with oyster-sauce; and the rest of the Christmas dinner was to consist of that noble sirloin of roast beef, and that immortal cod's head and shoulders! I had bought the materials for the pudding too, some half-hour previously: the plums and the currants, the citron and the allspice, the flour and the eggs. I was happy.
</p>
<p>
Onward, by the bright grocer's shops, thronged with pudding-purchasers! Onward, by the bookseller's, though lingering, it may be, for a moment, by the gorgeous Christmas books, with their bright binding, and brighter pictures. Onward, by the pastry cook's! Onward, elate, hilarious, and benignant, until, just as I stopped by a poulterer's shop, to admire the finest capon that ever London or Christmas saw, a hand was laid on my shoulder!
</p>
<p>
"Before our sovereign lady the Queen"--"by the grace of God, greeting"--" that you take the body of Thomas Prupper, and him safely keep"--" and for so doing, this shall be your warrant."
</p>
<p>
These dread and significant words swam before my dazzled eyelids, dancing maniac hornpipes on a parchment slip of paper. I was to keep Christmas in no other company than that of the once celebrated fictitious personage, supposed to be the familiar of all persons similarly situated--JOHN DOE.
</p>
<p>
I remembered with horror, that some fort-night previously, a lawyer's clerk deposited on my shoulder a slip of paper, which he stated to be the copy of a writ, and in which her Majesty the Queen (mixed up for the nonce with John, Lord Campbell) was pleased to command me to enter an appearance somewhere, by such a day, in order to answer the plaint of somebody, who said I owed him some money. Now, an appearance had not been entered, and judgment had gone by default, and execution had been obtained against me. The Sheriff of Middlesex (who is popularly, though erroneously, supposed to l>e incessantly running up and down in his bailiwick) had had a writ of fieri facias, vulgarly termed fi. fa. against my goods; but hearing, or satisfying himself by adroit espionage, that I had no goods, he had made a return of nulla bona. Then had he invoked the aid of a more subtle and potential instrument, likewise on parchment, called a capias ad satisfaciendum, abbreviated in legal parlance into ca. sa., against my body. This writ he had confided to Aminadab, his man; and Aminadab, running, as he was in duty bound to do, up and down in his section of the bailiwick, had come across me, and had made me the captive of his bow and spear. He called it, less metaphorically, "nabbing me."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Aminadab, (tall, aquiline-nosed, oleaginous, somewhat dirty; clad in a green Newmarket coat, a crimson velvet waist-coat, a purple satin neckcloth with gold flowers, two watch-guards, and four diamond rings,)--Mr. Aminadab proposed that "something should be done." Would I go to Whitecross-street at once? or to Blowman's, in Cursitor-street? or would I just step into Peele's Coffee-house for a moment? Mr. Aminadab was perfectly polite, and indefatigably suggestive.
</p>
<p>
The capture had been made in Fleet Street; so we stepped into Peele's, and while Mr. Aminadab sipped the pint of wine which he had obligingly suggested I should order, I began to look my position in the face. Execution taken out for forty-five pounds nine and ninepeuce. Ca. sa., a guinea; fi.fa., a guinea; capture, a guinea; those were all the costs as yet. Now, some days after I was served with the writ, I had paid the plaintiffs lawyer, on account, thirty pounds. In the innocence of my heart, I imagined that, by the County Court Act, I could not be arrested for the balance, it being under twenty pounds. Mr. Aminadab laughed with contemptuous pity.
</p>
<p>
"We do n't do business that way," said he; "we goes in for the whole lot, and then yon pleads your set-off, you know."
</p>
<p>
The long and the short of the matter was, that I had eighteen pounds, twelve shillings, and nine pence, to pay, before my friend in the purple neckcloth would relinquish his grasp; and that to satisfy the demand, I had exactly the sum of two pounds two and a half-penny, and a gold watch, on which a relation of mine would probably advance four pounds more. So, I fell to writing letters, Mr. Aminadab sipping the wine and playing with one of his watch-chains in the meanwhile.
</p>
<p>
I wrote to Jones, Brown, and Robinson--to Thompson, and to Jackson likewise. I wrote to my surly uncle in Pudding-lane. Now was the time to put the disinterested friendship of Brown to the test; to avail myself of the repeated offers of service from Jones; to ask for the loan of that sixpence which Robinson had repeatedly declared was at my command as long as he had a shilling. I sealed the letters with an unsteady hand, and consulted Mr. Aminadab as to their despatch. That gentleman, by some feat of legerdemain, called up from the bowels of the earth, or from one of those mysterious localities known as "round the corner," two sprites: one, his immediate assistant; seedier, however, and not jewelled, who carried a nobby stick which he continually gnawed. The other, a horrible little man with a white head and a white neckcloth, twisted round his neck like a halter. His eye was red, and his teeth were gone, and the odour of rum compassed him about, like a cloak. To these two acolytes my notes were confided, and they were directed to bring the answers like lightning to Blowman's. To Blowman's, in Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane, I was bound, and a cab was straightway called for my conveyance thereto. For the matter of that, the distance was so short, I might easily have walked, but I could not divest myself of the idea that everybody in the street knew I was a prisoner.
</p>
<p>
I was soon within the hospitable doors of Mr. Blowman, officer to the Sheriff of Middlesex. His hospitable doors were double, and, for more hospitality, heavily barred, locked, and chained. These, with the exceptions of barred windows, and a species of grating-roofed yard outside, like a monster bird-cage, were the only visible signs of captivity. Yet there was enough stone in the hearts, and iron in the souls, of Mr. Blowman's inmates, to build a score of lock-up houses. For that you may take my word.
</p>
<p>
I refused the offer of a private room, and was conducted to the coffee-room, where Mr. Aminadab left me, for a while, to my own reflections; and to wait for the answers to my letters.
</p>
<p>
They came--and one friend into the bargain. Jones had gone to Hammersmith, and wouldn't be back till next July. Brown had been disappointed in the City. Robinson's money was all locked up. Thompson expected to be locked up himself. Jackson was brief, but explicit: he said he "would rather not."
</p>
<p>
My friend brought me a carpet-bag, with what clothes I wanted in it. He advised me, moreover, to go to Whitecross Street at once, for a sojourn at Mr. Blowman's domicile would cost me something like a guinea per diem. So,' summoning Mr. Aminadab, who had obligingly waited to see if I could raise the money or not, I announced my intention of being conveyed to gaol at once. I paid half-a-guinea for the accommodation I had had at Mr. Blowman's; I made a pecuniary acknowledgment of Mr. Aminadab s politeness; and I did not fail to remember the old man in the white halter and the spirituous mantle. Then, when I had also remembered a red-headed little Jew boy who acted as Cerberus to this Hades, and appeared to be continually washing his hands (though they never seemed one whit the cleaner for the operation), another cab was called, and off I went to Whitecross Street, with a heart considerably heavier than a paving-stone.
</p>
<p>
I had already been three hours in captivity, and it was getting on for eight o'clock. The cab was proceeding along Holborn, and I thought, involuntarily, of Mr. Samuel Hall, black and grimy, making his progress through the same thoroughfare, by the Oxford Road, and so on to Tyburn, bowing to the crowd and cursing the Ordinary. The foot-pavement on either side was thronged with people at their Christmas marketing, or, at least, on some Christmas business--so it seemed to me. Goose Clubs were being held at the public-houses--sweeps for sucking-pigs, plum--puddings, and bottles of gin. Some ladies and gentlemen had begun their Christmas rather too early, and were meandering unsteadily over the flag-stones. Fiddlers were in great request, being sought for in small beershops, and borne off bodily from bars, to assist at Christmas Eve merry-makings. An immense deal of hand-shaking was going on, and I was very much afraid, a good deal more "standing" than was consistent with the strict rules of temperance. Everybody kept saying that it was "only once a year," and made that an apology (so prone are mankind to the use of trivial excuses!) for their sins against Father Mathew. Loud laughter rang through the frosty air. Pleasant jokes, innocent "chaff," passed; grocers' young men toiled lustily, wiping their hot faces ever and anon; butchers took no rest; prize beef melted away from very richness before my eyes; and in the midst of all the bustle and jollity, the crowding, laughing, drinking, and shouting, I was still on my unvarying way to Whitecross Street.
</p>
<p>
There was a man resting a child's coffin on a railing, and chattering with a pot-boy, with whom he shared a pot of porter, "with the sharp edge taken off." There are heavy hearts--heavier perchance than yours, in London this Christmas Eve, my friend Prupper, thought I. To-morrow's dawn will bring sorrow and faint-heartedness to many thousands--to oceans of humanity, of which you are but a single drop.
</p>
<p>
The cab had conveyed me through Smithfield Market, and now rumbled up Barbican. My companion, the gentleman with the crab-stick (to whose care Mr. Aminadab had consigned me) beguiled the time with pleasant and instructive conversation. He told me that he had "nabbed a many parties." That he had captured a Doctor of Divinity going to a Christmas, a bridegroom starting for the honeymoon, a Colonel of Hussars in full fig for her Majesty's drawing-room. That he had the honour once of "nabbing" the eldest son of a peer of the realm, who, however, escaped from him through a second-floor window, and over the tiles. That he was once commissioned io "nab" the celebrated Mr. Wix, of the Theatres Royal. That Mr. Wix, being in the act of playing the Baron Spolaccio, in the famous tragedy "Love, Ruin, and Revenge," he, Crabstick, permitted him, in deference to the interests of the drama, to play the part out, stationing an assistant at each wing to prevent escape. That the delusive Wix "bilked" him, by going down a trap. That he, Crabstick, captured him, notwithstanding, under the stage, though opposed by the gigantic Wix himself, two stage carpenters, a demon, and the Third Citizen. That Wix rushed on the stage and explained his position to the audience, whereupon the gallery (Wix being an especial favourite of theirs) expressed a strong desire to have his (Crabstick's) blood; and, failing to obtain that, tore up the benches; in the midst of which operation the recalcitrant Wix was removed. With these and similar anecdotes of the nobility, gentry, and the public in general, he was kind enough to regale me, until the cab stopped. I alighted in a narrow dirty street; was hurried up a steep flight of steps; a heavy door clanged behind me; and Crabstick, pocketing his small gratuity, wished me a good night and a merry Christmas. A merry Christmas: ugh!
</p>
<p>
That night I slept in a dreadful place, called the Reception ward,--on an iron bedstead, in a room with a stone floor. I was alone, and horribly miserable. I heard the Waits playing in the distance, and dreamed I was at a Christmas party.
</p>
<p>
Christmas morning in Whitecross Street Prison! A turnkey conducted me to the ' Middlesex side "--a long dreary yard--on either side of which were doors leading into wards, or coffee-rooms, on the ground floor, and, by stone-staircases, to sleeping apartments above. It was all very cold, very dismal, very gloomy. I entered the ward allotted to me, Number Seven, left. It was a long room, with barred windows, cross tables and benches, with an aisle between; a large fire at the farther end; "Dum spiro, spero," painted above the mantel-piece. Twenty or thirty prisoners and their friends were sitting at the tables, smoking pipes, drinking beer, or reading newspapers. But for the unmistakeable jail-bird look about the majority of the guests, the unshorn faces, the slipshod feet, the barred windows, and the stone floor, I might have fancied myself in a tap-room.
</p>
<p>
There was holly and mistletoe round the gas-pipes; but how woful and forlorn they looked! There was roast beef and plum-pudding preparing at the fire-place; but they had neither the odour nor the appearance of free beef and pudding. I was thinking of the cosy room, the snug fire, the well-drawn curtains, the glittering table, the happy faces, when the turnkey introduced me to the sfe ward of the ward (an officer appointed by the prisoners, and a prisoner himself) who "tallies you off," i.e., who allotted me a seat at one of the cross-tables, which was hence-forward mine for all purposes of eating, drinking, writing, or smoking; in consideration of a payment on my part of one guinea sterling. This sum made me also free of the ward, and entitled to have rriy boots cleaned, my bed made, and my meals cooked. Supposing that I had not possessed a guinea (which was likely enough), I should have asked for time, which would have been granted me; but, at the expiration of three days, omission of payment would have constituted me a defaulter; in which case, the best thing I could have done would have been to declare pauperism, and remove to the poor side of the prison. Here, I should have been entitled to my "sixpences," amounting, in the aggregate, to the sum of three shillings and sixpence a week towards my maintenance.
</p>
<p>
The steward, a fat man in a green "wide-awake" hat, who was incarcerated on remand for the damages in an action for breach of promise of marriage, introduced me to the cook (who was going up next week to the Insolvent Court, having filed his schedule as a beer-shop keeper). He told me, that if I chose to purchase anything at a species of everything shop in the yard, the cook would dress it; or, if I did not choose to be at the trouble of providing myself, I might breakfast, dine, and sup at his, the steward's, table, "for a consideration," as Mr. Trapbois has it. I acceded to the latter proposition, receiving the intelligence that turkey and oyster-sauce were to be ready at two precisely, with melancholy indifference. Turkey had no charms for me now.
</p>
<p>
I sauntered forth into the yard, and passed fifty or sixty fellow-unfortunates, sauntering as listlessly as myself. Strolling about, I came to a large grating, somewhat similar to Mr. Blowman's bird-cage, in which was a heavy gate called the "lock," and which communicated with the corridors leading to the exterior of the prison. Here sat, calmly surveying his caged birds within, a turnkey--not a repulsive, gruff-voiced monster, with a red neckerchief and top boots, and a bunch of keys, as turnkeys are popularly supposed to be--but a pleasant, jovial man enough, in sleek black. He had a little lodge behind, where a bright fire burned, and where Mrs. Turnkey, and the little Turnkeys lived. (I found a direful resemblance between the name of his office, and that of the Christmas bird). His Christmas dinner hung to the iron bars above him, in the shape of a magnificent piece of beef. Happy turnkey, to be able to eat it on the outer side of that dreadful grating! In another part of the yard hung a large black board, inscribed in half-effaced characters, with the enumerations of divers donations, made in former times by charitable persons, for the benefit in perpetuity of poor prisoners. To-day, so much beef and so much strong beer was allotted to each prisoner.
</p>
<p>
But what were beef and beer, what was unlimited tobacco, or even the plum-pudding, when made from prison plums, boiled in a prison copper, and eaten in a prison dining-room? What though surreptitious gin were carried in, in bladders, beneath the under garments of the fairer portion of creation; what though brandy were smuggled into the wards, disguised as black draughts, or extract of sarsaparilla? A pretty Christmas market I had brought my pigs to!
</p>
<p>
Chapel was over (I had come down too late from the "Reception" to attend it); and the congregation (a lamentably small one) dispersed in the yard and wards. I entered my own ward, to change (if anything could change) the dreary scene.
</p>
<p>
Smoking and cooking appeared to be the chief employments and recreations of the prisoners. An insolvent clergyman in rusty black, was gravely rolling out puff-paste on a pie-board; and a man in his shirt-sleeves, covering a veal cutlet with egg and breadcrum, was an officer of dragoons!
</p>
<p>
I found no lack of persons willing to enter into conversation with me. I talked, full twenty minutes, with a seedy captive, with a white head, and a coat buttoned and pinned up to the chin.
</p>
<p>
Whitecross Street, he told me (or Burden's Hotel, as in the prison slang he called it), was the only place where any "life" was to be seen. The Fleet was pulled down; the Marshalsea had gone the way of all brick-and-mortar; the Queen's Prison, the old "Bench," was managed on a strict system of classification and general discipline; and Horsemonger Lane was but rarely tenanted by debtors; but in favoured Whitecross Street, the good old features of imprisonment for debt yet nourished. Good dinners were still occasionally given; "fives" and football were yet played; and, from time to time, obnoxious attorneys, or importunate process-servers--"rats" as they were called--were pumped upon, floured, and bonneted. Yet, even Whitecross Street, he said with a-sigh, was falling off. The Small Debts Act and those revolutionary County Courts would be too many for it soon.
</p>
<p>
That tall, robust, bushy-whiskered man, (he said) in the magnificently flowered dressing-gown, the crimson Turkish smoking cap, the velvet slippers, and the ostentatiously displayed gold guard-chain, was a "mace-man:" an individual who lived on his wits, and on the want of wit in others. He had had many names, varying from Plantagenet and De Courcy, to "Edmonston and Co.," or plain Smith or Johnson. He was a real gentleman once upon a time--a very long time ago. Since then, he had done a little on the turf, and a great deal in French hazard, roulette, and rouge et noir. He had cheated bill-discounters, and discounted bills himself. He had been a picture-dealer, and a wine-merchant, and one of those mysterious individuals called a "commission agent." He had done a little on the Stock Exchange, and a little billiard-marking, and a little skittle-sharping, and a little thimblerigging. He was not particular. Bills, however, were his passion. He was under a cloud just now, in consequence of some bill-dealing transaction, which the Commissioner of Insolvency had broadly hinted to be like a bill-stealing one. However, he had wonderful elasticity, and it was to be hoped would soon get over his little difficulties. Meanwhile, he dined sumptuously, and smoked cigars of price; occasionally condescending to toss half-crowns in a hat with any of the other "nobs" incarcerated.
</p>
<p>
That cap, and the battered worn-out sickly frame beneath, (if I would have the goodness to notice them) were all that were left of a spruce, rosy-cheeked, glittering young ensign of infantry. He was brought up by an old maiden aunt, who spent her savings to buy him a commission in the army. He went from Slowchester Grammar School, to Fastchester Barracks. He was to live on his pay. He gambled a year's pay away in an evening. He made thousand guinea bets, and lost them. So the old denouement of the old story came round as usual. The silver dressing-case, got on credit--pawned for ready money; the credit-horses sold; more credit-horses bought; importunate creditors in the barrack-yard; a letter from the colonel; sale of his commission; himself sold up; then Mr. Aminadab, Mr. Blowman, Burdon's Hotel, Insolvent Court, a year's remand; and, an after life embittered by the consciousness of wasted time and talents, and wantonly-neglected opportunities.
</p>
<p>
My informant pointed out many duplicates of the gentleman in the dressing-gown. Also, divers Government clerks, who had attempted to imitate the nobs in a small way, and had only succeeded to the extent of sharing the same prison; a mild grey-headed old gentleman who always managed to get committed for contempt of court; and the one inevitable baronet of a debtor's prison, who is traditionally supposed to have eight thousand a year, and to stop in prison because he likes it--though, to say the truth, this baronet looked, to me, as if he didn't like it at all.
</p>
<p>
I was sick of all these, and of everything else in Whitecross Street, before nine o'clock, when I was at liberty to retire to my cold ward. So ended my Christmas-day--my first, and, I hope and believe, my last Christmas-day in prison.
</p>
<p>
Next morning my welcome friend arrived and set me free. I paid the gate-fees, and I gave the turnkeys a crown, and I gave the prisoners imbounded beer. I kept New Year's day in company with a pretty cousin with glossy black hair, who was to have dined with me on Christmas-day, and who took such pity on mo that she shortly became Mrs. Prupper. Our eldest boy was born, by a curious coincidence, next Christmas-day--which I kept very jovially, with the doctor, after it was all over, and we didn't christen him Whitecross.

<title>THE ORPHAN'S DREAM OF CHRISTMAS.</title>
<poem>
<poem1>IT was Christmas Eve--and lonely,</poem1>
<poem2>By a garret window high,</poem2>
<poem1>Where the city chimneys barely</poem1>
<poem2>Spared a hand's-breadth of the sky.</poem2>
<poem1>Sat a child, in age,--but weeping,</poem1>
<poem2>With a face so small and thin,</poem2>
<poem1>That it seem'd too scant a record</poem1>
<poem2>To have eight years traced therein.</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>Oh, grief looks most distorted</poem1>
<poem2>When his hideous shadow lies</poem2>
<poem1>On the clear and sunny life-stream</poem1>
<poem2>That doth fill a child's blue eyes!</poem2>
<poem1>But her eye was dull and sunken,</poem1>
<poem2>And the whiten' d cheek was gaunt,</poem2>
<poem1>And the blue veins on the forehead</poem1>
<poem2>Were the pencilling of Want.</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>And she wept for years like jewels,</poem1>
<poem2>Till the last year's bitter gall,</poem2>
<poem1>Like the acid of the story,</poem1>
<poem2>In itself had melted all;</poem2>
<poem1>But the Christmas time returned,</poem1>
<poem2>As an old friend, for whose eye</poem2>
<poem1>She would take down all the pictures</poem1>
<poem2>Sketch'd by faithful Memory,</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>Of those brilliant Christmas seasons,</poem1>
<poem2>When the joyous laugh went round;</poem2>
<poem1>When sweet words of love and kindness</poem1>
<poem2>Were no unfamiliar sound;</poem2>
<poem1>When, lit by the log's red lustre,</poem1>
<poem2>She her mother's face could see,</poem2>
<poem1>And she rock'd the cradle, sitting</poem1>
<poem2>On her own twin-brother's knee:</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>Of her father's pleasant stories;</poem1>
<poem2>Of the riddles and the rhymes,</poem2>
<poem1>All the kisses and the presents</poem1>
<poem2>That had mark'd those Christmas times</poem2>
<poem1>'Twas as well that there was no one</poem1>
<poem2>(For it were a mocking strain)</poem2>
<poem1>To wish her a merry Christmas,</poem1>
<poem2>For that could not come again.</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>How there came a time of struggling,</poem1>
<poem2>When, in spite of love and faith,</poem2>
<poem1>Grinding Poverty would only</poem1>
<poem2>In the end give place to Death;</poem2>
<poem1>How her mother grew heart-broken,</poem1>
<poem2>When her toil-worn father died,</poem2>
<poem1>Took her baby in her bosom,</poem1>
<poem2>And was buried by his side:</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>How she clung unto her brother</poem1>
<poem2>As the lust spar from the wreck,</poem2>
<poem1>But stem Death had come between them</poem1>
<poem2>While her arms were round his neck.</poem2>
<poem1>There were now no loving voices;</poem1>
<poem2>And, if few hands offered bread,</poem2>
<poem1>There were none to rest in blessing</poem1>
<poem2>On the little homeless head.</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>Or, if any gave her shelter,</poem1>
<poem2>It was less of joy than fear;</poem2>
<poem1>For they welcomed Crime more warmly</poem1>
<poem2>To the selfsame room with her.</poem2>
<poem1>But, at length they all grew weary</poem1>
<poem2>Of their sick and useless guest ;</poem2>
<poem1>She must try a workhouse welcome</poem1>
<poem2>For the helpless and distressed.</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>But she prayed; and the Unsleeping</poem1>
<poem2>In His ear that whisper caught:</poem2>
<poem1>So he sent down Sleep, who gave her</poem1>
<poem2>Such a respite as she sought;</poem2>
<poem1>Drew the fair head to her bosom,</poem1>
<poem2>Pressed the wetted eyelids close,</poem2>
<poem1>And, with softly-falling kisses,</poem1>
<poem2>Lulled her gently to repose.</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>Then she dreamed the angels, sweeping</poem1>
<poem2>With their wings the sky aside,</poem2>
<poem1>Raised her swiftly to the country</poem1>
<poem2>Where the blessed ones abide:</poem2>
<poem1>To a bower all flushed with beauty,</poem1>
<poem2>By a shadowy arcade,</poem2>
<poem1>Where a mellowness like moonlight</poem1>
<poem2>By the Tree of Life was made:</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>Where the rich fruit sparkled, star-like,</poem1>
<poem2>And pure flowers of fadeless dye</poem2>
<poem1>Poured their fragrance on the waters</poem1>
<poem2>That in crystal beds went by:</poem2>
<poem1>Where bright hills of pearl and amber</poem1>
<poem2>Closed the fair green valleys round,</poem2>
<poem1>And, with rainbow light, but lasting,</poem1>
<poem2>Were their glistening summits crown'd.</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>Then, that distant-burning glory,</poem1>
<poem2>'Mid a gorgeousness of light!</poem2>
<poem1>The long vista of Archangels</poem1>
<poem2>Could scarce chasten to her sight.</poem2>
<poem1>There sat One: and her heart told her</poem1>
<poem2>'Twas the same, who, for our sin,</poem2>
<poem1>Was once born a little baby</poem1>
<poem2>"In the stable of an inn."</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>There was music--oh, such music!--</poem1>
<poem2>They were trying the old strains</poem2>
<poem1>That a certain group of shepherds</poem1>
<poem2>Heard on old Judea's plains;</poem2>
<poem1>But, when that divinest chorus</poem1>
<poem2>To a softened trembling fell,</poem2>
<poem1>Love's true ear discerned the voices</poem1>
<poem2>That on earth she loved so well.</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>At a tiny grotto's entrance</poem1>
<poem2>A fair child her eyes behold,</poem2>
<poem1>With his ivory shoulders hidden</poem1>
<poem2>'Neath his curls of living gold;</poem2>
<poem1>And he asks them, "Is she coming?"</poem1>
<poem2>But ere any one can speak,</poem2>
<poem1>The white arms of her twin brother</poem1>
<poem2>Are once more about her neck.</poem2>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem1>Then they all come round her greeting;</poem1>

<title>WHAT CHRISTMAS IS AFTER A LONG ABSENCE.</title>
<p>
SIXTEEN years have past since, a turbulent, discontented boy, I left England for Australia. My first serious study of geography began when I twirled about a great globe to find South Australia, which was then the fashionable colony. My guardians--I was an orphan--were delighted to get rid of so troublesome a personage; so, very soon I was the proud possessor of a town and country lot of land in the model colony of South Australia.
</p>
<p>
My voyage in a capital ship, with the best fare every day, and no one to say "Charles, you have had enough wine," was pleasant enough: very different from the case of some of my emigrating companions--fathers and mothers with families, who had left good homes, good incomes, snug estates, and respectable professions, excited by speeches at public meetings, or by glowing pamphlets, descriptive of the charms of a colonial life in a model colony. I learned to smoke, drink grog, and hit a bottle swung from the yard-arm, with pistol or rifle. We had several very agreeable scamps on board; ex-cornets and lieutenants, ex-government clerks, spoiled barristers and surgeons, plucked Oxonians, empty, good-looking, well-dressed fellows, who had smoked meerschaums, drunk Champagne, Hock, and Burgundy, fought duels, ridden steeple-chases, and contracted debts in every capital in Europe. These distinguished gentlemen kindly took me under their patronage, smoked my cigars, allowed me to stand treat for Champagne, taught me, at some slight expense, the arts of short whist, écarté, and unlimited loo; and to treat with becoming hauteur any advances on the part of the intermediate passengers.
</p>
<p>
By the end of the one hundred days of our voyage, I was remarkably altered, but whether improved, may be a question; as the leading principles I had imbibed, were to the effect, that work of any kind was low, and that debts were gentlemanly. My preconceived notions of a model colony, with all the elements of civilisation, as promised in London, were rather upset, by observing, on landing, just within the wash of high-water, on the sandy beach, heaps of furniture, a grand piano or two, and chests of drawers in great numbers; and I especially remember a huge iron-banded oak plate-chest, half full of sand, and empty. The cause of this wholesale abandonment was soon made plain to me, in the shape of a charge of ten pounds for conveying my trunks in a bullock wagon, of which they formed less than half the load, seven miles from the port to the city of Adelaide;--the said city, which looked so grand in water colours in the Emigration Rooms in London, being at that time a picturesque and uncomfortable collection of tents, mud huts, and wooden cottages, curiously warped, rather larger than a New-foundland dog's kennel, but letting for the rent of a mansion in any agricultural county of England.
</p>
<p>
It is not my intention, now, to tell the tale of the fall of the Model Colony and colonists of South Australia, and the rise of the Copper Mines, which I did not stay to see. When a general smash was taking place on all sides, I accepted the offer of a rough diamond of an overlander, who had come across from the old colony with a lot of cattle and horses to sell to the Adelaideans. He had taken a fancy to me in consequence of the skill I had displayed in bleeding a valuable colt at a critical moment; one of the few useful things I had learned in England; and, when my dashing companions were drinking themselves into delirium tremens, enlisting in the police, accepting situations as shepherds, sponging for dinners on the once-despised "snobs" and imploring the captains of ships to let them work their way home before the mast, he offered to take me with him to his station in the interior, and "make a man of me.'" I turned my back on South Australia, and abandoned my country lot, on an inaccessible hill, to nature, and sold my town lot for five pounds. I began to perceive that work was the only means of getting on in a colony.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, into the far Bush I went, and on the plains of a new-settled district, all solitary; constantly in danger from savage blacks; constantly occupied in looking after the wild shepherds and stockmen (herdsmen) of my overland friend; passing days on horse-back at one period; at another, compelled to give my whole attention to the details of a great establishment,--I rubbed off my old skin.
</p>
<p>
My fashionable affectations died away; my life became a reality, dependent on my own exertions. It was then that my heart began to change; it was then that I began to think tenderly of the brothers and sisters I had left behind, and with whom I had communicated so little in the days of my selfishness. Rarely oftener than twice in a year could I find means to forward letters; but the pen, once so hateful to me, became now, in hours of leisure, my great, resource. Often and often have I sat in my hut at midnight, filling pages with my thoughts, my feelings, my regrets. The fire burning before my hut, where mv men were sleeping, reminded me that I was not alone in the great pastoral desert, which sloping away from my station, rolled for hundreds of miles. Every sound was redolent of the romance of the strange land to which I had transplanted myself. The howl of the dingo prowling round my sheep-folds; the defying bark of my watchful dogs; the cry of the strange night-birds; and sometimes, echoing from the rocky ranges, the wild mountainous songs of the fierce aborigines, as they danced their corrobberies, and acted dramas representing the slaughter of the white man, and the plunder of his cattle. When such noises met my ear, I looked up to the rack where my arms lay, ready loaded, and out to where a faithful sentinel, the rebel O'Donohue, or the poacher, Giles Brown, with musket on shoulder paced up and down, ready to die, but not to surrender. In this great desert, the petty cares, mean tricks of land jobbing, all the little contrivances for keeping up appearances no longer needed, were forgotten. My few books were not merely read; they were learned by heart. If in the morning I tired horses in galloping my rounds, and settled strife among my men with rude words, and even blows; in the evening, sitting apart, I was lost in the wanderings of Abraham, the trials of Job, or the Psalms of David.
</p>
<p>
I followed St. John into the wilderness, not unlike that before my eyes, and listened far from cities to the Sermon on the mount. At other times, as I paced along the open forests, I made the woods resound with the speeches of Homer's heroes, or the outbursts of Shakspeare's characters--outbursts that came home to me: for, in those lone regions, I was chief, warrior, and almost priest; for, when there was a death, I read the funeral service. And thus I educated myself.
</p>
<p>
While thus recalling friends neglected, and opportunities misused, and pleasant scenes of Eastern County life, I most loved to dwell upon the Christmas time of dear old England.
</p>
<p>
In our hot summer of Australian December, when the great river that divided and bounded my pastures drivelled to a string of pools, and my cattle were panting around at the quiet hour of the evening, when the stars, shining with a brilliancy unknown in northern climes, realised the idea of the blessed night when the star of Bethlehem startled and guided the kings of the Eastern world on their pious pilgrimage,--my thoughts travelled across the sea to England. I did not feel the sultry heat, or hear the cry of the night-bird, or the howl of the dingoe. I was across the sea, among the Christinas revellers. I saw the gay flushed faces of my kindred and friends shining round the Christmas table; the grace was said, the toast went round. I heard my own name mentioned, and the grew sad. Then I awoke from my dream and found myself alone, and wept. But in a life of action there is no time for useless grieving, though time enough lor reflection and resolution. Therefore, after visions like these, I resolved that the time should come when, on a Christmas-day, the toast "to absent friends" should be answered by the Australian himself.
</p>
<p>
The time did come--this very year of the half century. Earnest labour and sober economy had prospered with me. The rich district in which I was one of the earliest pioneers, had become settled and pacified, as far as the river ran; the wild MyaIs had grown into the tame, blanket-clothed dependents of the settlers. Thousands of fine-woolled flocks upon the hills, and cattle upon the rich flats, were mine; the bark hut had changed into a verandahed cottage, where books and pictures formed no insignificant part of the furniture; neighbours were within a ride; the voices of children often floated sweetly along the waters of the river.
</p>
<p>
Then said I to myself, I can return now. Not to remain; for the land I have conquered from the wilderness shall be my home for life: but I will return, to press the hands that have longed for many years to press mine; to kiss away the tears that dear sisters shed when they think of me, once almost an outcast; to take upon my knees those little ones who have been taught to pray for their "uncle in a far land across the broad deep sea." Perhaps I had a thought of winning some rosy English face and true English heart to share my pastoral home.
</p>
<p>
I did return, and trod again the shores of my mother country. My boyish expectations had not been realised, but better hopes had. I was not returning laden with treasures, to rival the objects of my foolish youthful vanity; but I was returning thankful, grateful, contented, independent, to look round once more on my native land, and then return to settle in the land of my adoption.
</p>
<p>
It was mid-winter when I landed at a small fishing village in the extreme west of England; for my impatience made me take ad van during a calm in the Channel, of the first fisher's boat that boarded us.
</p>
<p>
The nearer we approached the shore, the more impatient I grew to land. I insisted on giving my help to one of the heavy oars; and no sooner had we touched the ground, than, throwing myself into the water, I waded on shore. Oh, easy-going men of the great world, there are some pleasures you can never taste; and among them is the enthusiasm, the heart-felt, awe-stricken admiration of the dweller among pastoral plains when he finds himself once more at home among the gardens of England!
</p>
<p>
Garden is the only word to express the appearance of England, especially the west, where the bright green myrtle lingers through the winter, and the road-side near every town is bordered with charming cottages. At every mile I found some new object of admiration, above all, the healthful fresh cheeks of the people; especially the sturdy, yet delicate-complexioned lasses tripping away, basket in hand, from the markets in numbers, startling to one who had lived long where the arrival of one fair white face was an event.
</p>
<p>
The approach to the first great town was signalised by tokens less pleasing--nay, absolutely painful;--beggars, as I passed, stood in their rags and whined for alms; and others, not less pitiful in appearance, did not beg, but looked so wan and miserable, that it made my heart bleed. I gave to all, so that the man who drove me stared. He stared still more, when I told him that I came from a country where there were no poor, save the drunken and the idle.
</p>
<p>
Entering a great town, the whirl, the commotion of passers on foot, on horseback, and in vehicles of all kinds, made me giddy; it was like a sort of nightmare. The signs of wealth, the conveniences provided for every imaginable want, were very strange to me, fresh from a country where able-bodied labour was always in demand, while a man thought himself equal to the longest journey, through an untrodden country, with a blanket and a tin-pot for all his furniture, and all his cooking apparatus.
</p>
<p>
When I called in the landlord of the Inn to consult about getting on to Yorkshire in two days, as I wished to be with my friends as soon as possible, he said, "If you stay and rest to-night, you can get there by the railroad tomorrow morning, in good time to eat your Christmas dinner." I had never thought of that, and had only a vague idea what a railroad was like.
</p>
<p>
I reached the starting-place next morning, just in time to take my seat in a departing train. I started when, with a fearful sound of labouring machinery, we moved: then whirled away. I was ashamed of my fears; yet there were many in that train to whom a sea voyage would have only been less terrible than the solitary land journeys on horseback through the Bush of Australia, which were to me a mere matter of course. Without accident, I reached the station near York, where I had to take a conveyance to reach by a cross country road the house where I knew that one of my brothers, farming a few hundred acres of his own land, assembled as many of our family as possible at Christmas time.
</p>
<p>
The little inn was able to supply a gig, driven by a decayed post-boy. Plunging at once into questioning conversation, I found an old acquaintance in the driver, without revealing who I was. Not many years older than myself, soured, disappointed, racked in health, he took a different view of life to anything I had yet heard. All along my road through England I had been struck by the prosperous condition of the well-to-do people I had met in first-class carriages. His occupation, his glory, was departed; he was obliged to do anything, and wear anything, instead of his once smart costume, and once pleasant occupation--instead of his gay jacket, and rapid ride, and handsome presents from travellers, and good dinners from landlords. In doleful spirits, he had a score of tales to tell of others worse off than himself--of landlords of posting-houses in the workhouse, and smart four-in-hand coachmen begging their bread of farmers sunk down to labourers; and other doleful stories of the fate of those who were not strong enough for the race of life in England. Then I began to see there are two sides to the life that looked so brilliant out of the plate-glass windows of a first-class carriage.
</p>
<p>
The luxuries and comforts which taxes and turnpikes buy, are well worth the cost to those who can pay them; those who cannot, will do better to make shift in a colony. Thus thinking and talking, as I approached the place where, unexpected, I was to appear before a gathering of my relations, my flow of spirits died away. The proud consciousness of having conquered fortune, the beauty of the winter scenery (for winter, with its hoar frost shading the trees and foliage, has strange dazzling beauty to the eyes of those who have been accustomed to the one perpetual green-brown of semi-tropical Australia) had filled me full to overflowing with bounding joyousness. Gaily I answered back to the "Good night, master," of the passing peasantry, and vigorously puffed at my favourite pipe, in clouds that rivalled and rolled along with the clouds of mist that rose from the sweating horses. But the decayed postilion's stories of misery, in which he seemed to revel, damped me. My pipe went out, and my chin sunk despoudingly on my breast. At length I asked, "Did he know the Barnards?" "Oh, yes, he knew them all." Mr. John had been very lucky with the railroad through one of his farms. He had ridden a pair at Miss Margaret's wedding, and driven a mourning coach at Miss Mary's funeral. The mare in the gig had belonged to Mr. John, and had been a rare good hunter. Mr. Robert had doctored him for his rheumatics. "Did he know any more?" "Oh, yes; there was Master Charles; he went abroad somewhere to furren parts. Some people say he's dead, got killed, or hung, or something; and some say he's made a power of money. He was a wild slip of a lad. Many a time he's been out in the roads with some one I know very well, snaring hares and smoking of pheasants. There's a mark on my forehead now, where I fell, when he put a furze bush under the tail of a colt I was breaking. He was a droll chap, surely." There was scarcely a kind feeling in the poor man's breast. The loss of his occupation, poverty, and drink, had sadly changed the fine country lad, barely ten years older than myself, whom I had left behind in England. So, turning, I said, "Well, Joe, you don't seem to remember me; I am Charles Barnard." "Lord, sir!" he answered, in a whining tone, "I beg your pardon. You are a great gentleman; I always thought you would be. So, you are going to dine with Mr. John 1 Well, sir, I hope you won't forget a Christmas-box, for old acquaintance sake?" I was repelled, and wished myself back in Australia; my mind began to misgive me as to the wisdom of my unexpected visit.
</p>
<p>
It was bright moonlight when we drove into the village. I had a mile to walk; I would not let chattering Joe drive me; so left him happy over a iiot supper, with no stinted allowance of ale. I walked on quickly, until approaching the old house--the mansion-house, once, but the estates had long been divided from it--I paused. My courage failed as I passed through the gate; their clang disturbed the dogs they began to bark fiercely. I was a stranger; the dogs that knew me were all dead. Twice I paced round, with difficulty repressing my emotion, before I could find courage to approach the door. The peals of laughter, the gay music that rang out from time to time, the lights flying from window to window of the upper rooms, filled me with pleasing-painful feelings, long unknown. There was folly in my mysterious arrival; but romance is part of a life of solitude. Unreasonably, I was for a moment vexed that they could be so merry; but next moment better thoughts prevailed. I stepped to the well-remembered door, and rang a great peal; the maid opened it to me without question, for many guests were expected. As I stooped to lay aside my cloak and cap, a lovely child in white ran down the stairs, threw her arms round my neck, and, with a hearty kiss, cried, "I have caught you under the mistletoe, cousin Alfred." Then she started from me, and loosening her hold, and staring at me with large timid brown eyes, said, "--Who are you? you are not a new uncle, are you?" Oh, how my heart was relieved! the child saw a likeness; I should not be disowned. All my plans, all my preparations were forgotten; I was in the midst of them; and after fifteen years I saw again the Christmas fire, the Christmas table, the Christmas faces, that I had dreamed of so often! To describe that night is impossible. Long after midnight, we sat; the children unwillingly left my knees for bed; my brothers gazed and wondered; my sisters crowded round me, kissed my brown-bearded cheeks, and pressed my sun-burned hands. Many new scenes of blessed Christmas may I have; never one like that which welcomed the wanderer home!
</p>
<p>
But although England has its blessed seasons and festivals, in which Christmas-day stands first; and, although that Christmas meeting will often and again be before my eyes, I cannot stay in England. My life is molded to my adopted country; and where I have earned fortune, there I will spend it. The restraints, the conventionalities, the bonds created by endless divisions of society, are more than I can endure; care seems to sit on every brow, and scornful pride in imaginary social superiority on too many.
</p>
<p>
I have found the rosy English face, and the true English heart! Some one who listened to the Australian stories of my Christmas week, which my friends were never tired of hearing, is ready to leave all and follow me to my pastoral home. I am now preparing for departure; and neither society, nor books, nor music, will be wanting in what was, when I first knew it, a forest and grassy desert, peopled with wild birds and kangaroos. Nearly twenty relations accompany me; some of them poor enough. In a few years you may find the Barnard-town settlement on Australian maps; and there, at Christmas time, or any time, true men and good women shall meet with welcome and help from me , for I shall never forget that I once began the world, a shepherd in a solitude, and gazed on the bright stars of a Christmas-night, shining in a hot and cloudless sky.

<title>WHAT CHRISTMAS IS IF YOU OUT GROW IT.</title>
<p>
THE floods round the little classic town of Bulferry were frozen. The trees round the meadows of St. Agnus Dei de Pompadour were the same. Dons went to chapel regularly, but the Dean of St. Agnus appeared in an extensive funeral-looking cloak, and the Sub-Dean coughed louder, and made more mistakes in the responses, by reason of deafness, than heretofore. Coal and Blanket Societies were talked of. In few words, Christmas was fast approaching, and University men were looking forward to spending that season in town or country, according to their residence, inclinations, or invitations.
</p>
<p>
Among the many young men who stood on the platform, awaiting the blazing dragon, which in two hours' time was to convey them, to London, perhaps to take a chop at the "Cock," a little dinner at Verrey's,and a three-and-sixpenny cab-fare to some other station, was Mr. Horace De Lisle, a freshman, who had come "up" in the preceding October, and was now hastening back to the paternal hearth at St. Maurice, a charming little vicarage in Warwickshire, just large enough to be the best house in the village, just small enough to be sociable, allowing of half-a-dozen spare beds. Practically religious, without any morbid affectation of any "isms," the Rev. Augustus De Lisle was the best and most popular parson for miles round. His income might be some four hundred a year, besides a little property in the funds; but judicious economy, and a little success i "gentleman farming," made it go very far, and St. Maurice rectory boasted its occasional dinner party, its billiard room, and its plain carriage; while few of the poor or sick ever went away unrelieved. Mrs. De Lisle was good and clever woman, and educated her own daughters; which saved money and morals at the same time.
</p>
<p>
However, like the generality of clergymen who have not much preferment, and who really do good, the Rev. Augustus De Lisle had a large family. Girls, even when educated at home, cost something; boys cost a great deal more, and cannot be kept at home. Two or three had been got off his hands, but Horace had been a pet boy, kept at home a good deal through ill health. He was very amiable, loved his sisters and mother, and his father had made him a capital scholar. Several people were surprised when he took the St. Agnus Dei scholarship, and took the "bounce" out of the Tipton and Whortleberry boys at the same time.
</p>
<p>
And so Horace had been sent to the University, with the promise of eighty or a hundred pounds a year from his father, an odd present of fifty from an aunt, and a lot of tears, blessings, and hints at advice from his mother. He had now passed his first term. He had made up his mind to take a "double first," the Iceland scholarship, and the English verse; he found Arnold's Thucydides a very stupid book, and wondered how it was that nothing "took" in the publishing way, unless it was "translated from the German." He believed in "stunning feeds," and began to have some ideas on the subject of claret.
</p>
<p>
But he had still far too much love for home to find even a lingering inclination for a further stay. Moreover, ambition seemed to send him homeward. The Dean had said, in a grufl voice, "Very well, sir!" to his construing of the "Birds" of Aristophanes; the Rev. John o' Gaunt, his tutor, had expanded his lank lips into a smile, and had commended his Latinity; and here was news for his father! Again, he wanted to see Jack Harrowgate, his old shooting companion, to whom his favourite sister Lucy was engaged. Jack was a tremendous rough manly fellow, with a very kind heart, and great powers of sociability. Even Bruiser, of St. Alb-Cornice, who had thrashed the "Bunstead Grinder," shrank into insignificance when compared with Jack; and Smilliugton, of St. Una de Lion, could not sing, "Down among the dead men," half so well. Besides all this, Horace had some few private anxieties and doubts--of which anon.
</p>
<break/>
<p>
Great as was the readiness and frequency with which slang phrases were bandied to and fro at the University, there was one little word which seemed more in use than any, and which half the University appeared to be living to illustrate.
</p>
<p>
When Horace first appeared at St. Agnus Dei, one of his first proceedings was to pay for his furniture; and to purchase the good-will of the cups and saucers of the last inmate of his rooms. Several other ready-money transactions, on a small scale, evinced his desire and intention of avoiding debt; and as his father had not only advised him to do so, but had furnished him with the means of eking out the small allowance of his scholarship, he himself felt ill-justified in overrunning his known income.
</p>
<p>
But that word was sounding, ringing, dinning, and booming in his ears, hour after hour, day after day. That word was staring in his face; whizzing before his eyes; insinuating itself into his food; adulterating the wine he drank. It stared at him in the form of one man's boots (so much better fitting than old Last's, at St. Maurice); in the broad stripe of another man's elegantly-cut trousers; in the glossy hat of another; in the faultless, close-to-the-waste-when-unbuttoned dress coat of another. It took all sorts of forms. It would transfer itself into a walking-cane, at one end of a street; and at the end of another, it had suddenly become a plaid scarf, or a coral-headed breast-pin. Sometimes it would appear as a Yorkshire pie; sometimes as a musical box. At one moment, just as he thought it was a pair of hair-brushes, it would suddenly turn itself into a steak and oyster sauce at Cliften's. In the dreams of men, it would haunt them; in their walks, it would cling to their very feet; in their reading moments, it lay open before them; in their smoking ones, it fumed with them. And that word was tick, tick, TICK.
</p>
<p>
But Horace was not in debt. Oh no! He had only commenced a few accounts for things which "one could not very well pay for till the end of term;" and when the end ot berm came, he found he was obliged to write home for five pounds to come home with, and this, as it was his first term, his father thought nothing of. Then, he had "been obliged" to order "one or two things" at Stilty and Cabbagenet, the great tailor's; but there could be no harm in that, because their names were put down on the list of tradesmen his tutor had handed him. Then, there were one or two little presents for his sisters, and a ring and a new watch-chain, which "he could pay for next term," and one or two other matters--but "nothing of consequence."
</p>
<p>
If you had seen how Horace kissed his sisters and mother, and how happy and how jolly he seemed when he got home, you would have been pleased, I think. He was certainly more manly in speech and manner, and more confident in expressing opinions; but he had lost none of his social frankness and good-nature. But Christmas was getting lose at hand, and Horace, somehow or other, did not evince so lively an interest in the reparations for it as formerly. He said something in reference to "their always boring about mince-meat;" and he thought the charity-school dinner might be managed cheaper and ith less trouble at the school-house, than in their own kitchen.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, his father could scarcely understand the necessity of his reading in a bright-coloured chintz gown, lined with bright red silk, although his sisters thought it very pretty. His mother was afraid that his set of studs, representing little bunches of jewelled grapes, must have been rather expensive--"But then, he had always been a quiet boy at home, and would not do so again." He also drank more wine, and once laughed about "boys taking two glasses of port after dinner;" he ordered some pale ale up from London; and abused tea as ditch-water, alleging that it hurt his nerves, and prevented him from reading. He called his pony a "mere hack," and showed discrimination in matters relating to horseflesh.
</p>
<p>
But all these were minor difficulties, and Horace had too much real goodness of heart to ask his father for more money, or to obtrude his artificial wants except in fits of occasional peevishness. Besides, the Bishop of St. Epps was so pleased with his début at St. Agnus Dei, that he had obtained for him an "exhibition," which put another thirty pounds a-year into his pocket. This comforted him on the score of his present experiments with TICK.
</p>
<p>
Christmas passed away, merrily. The house was a perfect bower of holly; good, whole-some dinners, and lively hearty parties in the evening, "kept" the St. Maurice Christmas in genuine, downright style. And then came more junketing. Laura, thinking that there was no particular occasion to run away to the Lakes, as if marriage were a wicked action, said "yes" one evening to a curious question of Jack Harrington's, and absolutely got married next week. You may fancy what everybody said and did upon that occasion!
</p>
<break/>
<p>
And now came the time for Horace to go back. Despite the domesticity of home, despite the absence of cold ducks at breakfast, of claret after dinner, and of lobster salad for supper--despite the rough Avant of etiquette, which led Jack Harrington to dance with his own wife, to prefer the ale of the St. Maurice and the Goat to Bass or Allsopp, and to drink healths at his own dinner parties,--Horace had not found so sincere, or so soundly rational a companion at college. He went back and with some regrets.
</p>
<centre>* * * * * * *</centre>
<p>
It is a full three years, perhaps a trifle more, since Horace spent Christmas at his parental home. Many changes have taken place in that time. Laura is getting matronly on the strength of baby Number Two. Jack is getting additionally serious; looks more sharply after business; and gives fewer (though not less sociable) parties. The Reverend the Vicar of St. Maurice has got a small prebend, with the profits of which, he has insured his life in favour of three yet unmarried daughters. This Christinas at St. Maurice bids fair to rival all past Christmases in jollity, merriment, and social delight. Jack has just cleared </p>
<p>
a few hundreds by a lucky hit of judicious speculation, and declares he will spare no 'se in celebrating baby Number One's second birth-day, which falls on "boxing" day.
</p>
<p>
But where is Horace? Will he be as sociable as he used to be? Will he come up a prodigy of scholarship and good-nature, half a don, yet with a whole, and a sound heart? The train is expected; crowds are waiting ou th platform, just as they waited this time three years since, and--Horace is among them.
</p>

But which is Horace? It cannot be that young gentleman with haughty looks, a delicately-robust or robustly-delicate figure, a bundle of whips in his hand, and two Scotch terriers held in with a string! It cannot be. that white-over-coated, crushed-hatted, striped-shirted individual! And yet it is he too. With whom is he talking? It cannot be yes! it is, it must be the Honourable Charley Cracker. Where are they going? Surely Horace will go direct home? We doubt it.
</p>
<p>
Arrived in London--a little dinner at some West End house--beat up Sprigs, now in the 12th. Two or three fellows that the Honourable Charley Cracker knows--Horace must know them. "De Lisle, of St. Agnus Dei." "Permit me to introduce you to my friend Sprigs, formerly of St. Walnuts De Grove capital fellow only sent away for smashing the college pump (this in an aside). Adjourn to the Lyceum--farce getting slow--so on to the Claret Cup, to hear Mr. Pope sing the "Cross Bones "and" O, Mrs. Manning! "Get tired, so on again to the Parthenon Saloon--no dancing--only look on--feel seedy--soda-water and brandy too light; pale ale, squeamish; porter, too heavy; and so to bed at Jarrett's Hotel. Headache--late hours in the morning fish breakfast at Greenwich--rather better--" may as well go home in a day or two as now," &amp;c., &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
A day or two is soon gone. Horace thinks he may as well go and "look in at the governor;" and so he leaves the Honourable Charley Cracker. Honourable Charley Cracker is not a rogue or a sharper. He is merely an ass. He is a pupil of Horace De Lisle besides, who has taken to "coaching," and is open to any eligible offer with which ten or seventeen pounds a term is connected. He quits London witli a sigh, takes out his purse with another, and a deeper sigh.
</p>
<p>
Laura is as pretty a young mamma as you will meet in a long summer-day's walk, and Horace cannot help thinking so. But he don't like babies; and baby Number One has taken alarm at his handsomest terrier, and is squalling energetically. Jack's old-fashioned house, with the window-door opening into a little snuggery of flowers and vegetables, is very different to Lady De Mont-faucon's conservatory, where he used to play chess, smoke cigars, and sometimes read, with his last long vacation pupil, the future Earl of Spitalfields. At home it is much the same. There is not so much as a bottle of hock in the whole cellar; they will let the cat sleep on the rug in the dining-room, and the carriage is the same old-fashioned "tub" as ever.
</p>
<p>
However, he gets over baby's birthday tolerably well, although he wishes Jack didn't know so many farmers. Besides, Jack will nurse baby Junior himself, and will hawk out baby Senior to shake his diminutive fists, at new comers in general. He feels glad to get back again to the rectory, but it is very slow there. His father doesn't know the Montmorencies, nor the Honourable Charley Cracker, and wonders why he did not get the fellowship at St. Swithin. Furthermore, Bessy and Fanny have both got beaux, and the beaux are not University men. Tom Harris, the surgeon, would never do to introduce to the Honourable Charley, although Tom has a snug little practice, and has furnished his house in a style that will outlast half a thousand University friendships, and will make Bessy a thoroughly good husband. Fanny's intended is the new curate, who is not over High Church; in fact, Horace thinks him rather a "pump," and wonders how he can live upon a hundrjd and twenty pounds a year.
</p>
<p>
Horace owes a few odd hundred pounds; but Standish and Co. and Stilty and Cabbagenet are very quiet as yet, and he will give them a "few pounds" as soon as he can spare it. In fact, half the bills have not yet been sent in, for his debts are mostly of latter-day University growth. He has done respectably well in the school, but nothing more. He has, however, a large connexion, picks up pupils, and does hope to pick up something else: indefinitely oscillating between the living of Dumdum, in the gift of the Montmorency family (his scholarship will give him a title); something under government (he knows the Prime Minister's aunt's second cousin); and the Woolsack. But all his friends, who used to hear him decide the fate of the Continent in a speech of twenty minutes, at the Vox et præterea Nihil Association, fill him with notions of briefs, oyster breakfasts, and the Temple. The difficulty is, the money. Cold-blooded as he is grown to home associations, he has no heart to rob Bessy and Fanny of the few hundreds their father can give with them; still less to stint the younger members of their just meed of what he has himself enjoyed. But he is an unhappy creature. He wants everything and everybody--except the things and people around him; he is reserved where he used to be open, parsimonious from necessity where he was once generous. He cannot settle to anything, and the few days he has been at home have bored him as much as the conversation of the Honourable Charley Avould have bored his father. Other people perceive the change, and even he begins to have a glimpse of self-reproach.
</p>
<p>
But, just as he is wondering why the deuce he thought of spending Christmas at home, a reprieve arrives in the shape of a letter from The Honorable Charley; who, having in an evil hour accepted an invitation to his guardian's, finds he has nobody to smoke or drink pale ale with, and conceives a sudden desire for reading. The pay is liberal; and, if it were not, getting away from home for the remaining nine or ten days of the vacation would be a fair equivalent for any amount of instruction likely to be imbibed by the mental absorbents of Charley's mind.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. De Lisle cannot bear the idea of her "dear boy" leaving home before even the pudding is finished, especially as Jack Harrington has invited the whole family to keep Twelfth Night. Twelfth Night at Jack's! Noisy children, country dances, perhaps snap-dragon, and perhaps blindman's buff, with sisters Bessy and Fanny slipping out on the staircase, and coming in with heightened complexions, looking as if they had been kissed by goblins in human shape. Twelfth Night characters, too! Perhaps draw a love motto with Polly Bright, the old half-pay admiral's daughter, about whom he once liked to be teased. Never!
</p>
<p>
And so Horace goes away. His father, perhaps, feels but little grieved; for he hopes and thinks that his son's journey may tend to his future advantage, and he is too sensible to cherish that home-sickness which sometimes prevents a man from ever making a home for himself. But his mother cannot bear his sublime disdain of all the little innocent things that once called forth his highest approbation. She is almost afraid Polly Bright looks thin and anxious; and she remembers that, just three years ago, Horace joked about his "little wife;" and she wishes that, even by one kind look, he had repeated the joke. It is all one to Horace, who is gone.
</p>
<p>
To be happy, Horace, or to be really merry? My friend, my friend, a word in your ear! You may be quite sure that you have grown too fast, when you find that you have outgrown Christmas. It is a very bad sign indeed.

<title>THE ROUND GAME OF THE CHRISTMAS BOWL.</title>
<p>
[THIS Round Game, which comes, originally, from Fairy-Land, is thus played. The Pool of the game is a capacious circular bowl, or basin, made of ice. It is some sixty or seventy feet in circumference, and all round the rim there is stuck a hedge of holly-boughs, in full berry, interspersed with coloured lamps and silver bells. Everybody who is inspired by Christmas festivities comes to put into the Pool. He is to put in something which is his pride. In doing this he generally throws in something which is equally his trouble; and thus, by doing a generous act at Christmas, in throwing away his pride, he at the same time gets rid of one of his worst troubles.]
</p>
<section>The Rhyme.</section>
<poem>
<poem2>HERE is a Pool, all made of ice,</poem2>
<poem3>For a great round Christmas Game!</poem3>
<poem2>Its rim is set with green holly boughs,</poem2>
<poem3>And lamps of colour'd flame;</poem3>
<poem2>With silver bells that tinkle and gingle</poem2>
<poem2>As each one his offering comes to mingle,--</poem2>
<poem2>Whether ingot of gold, or a grey sea shingle.</poem2>
<poem1>Who comes first?--'Tis the King, I declare,</poem1>
<poem1>With the crown in his hand, and the frost in his hair</poem1>
<poem2>Close to the Pool he brings his crown,</poem2>
<poem3>And tosses it o'er the holly!</poem3>
<poem2>So, away to the bottom goes all his pride,</poem2>
<poem3>And his royal melancholy;</poem3>
<poem4>While gingle! tinkle! gingle!</poem4>
<poem5>How the sweet bells ring!</poem5>
<poem4>And round about the lighted Pool</poem4>
<poem5>We gambol, dance, and sing!</poem5>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem2>Who comes next?--</poem2>
<poem3>'Tis a Minister of State,</poem3>
<poem2>With a Puzzle made of weights and wheels,</poem2>
<poem3>And balanced on his pate!</poem3>
<poem2>To the Pool of Christmas Offerings</poem2>
<poem3>The Treasury Lord advances;</poem3>
<poem2>Souse over, goes his Puzzle,</poem2>
<poem3>And away his Lordship dances!</poem3>
<poem4>While gingle! tinkle! gingle!</poem4>
<poem5>How the sweet bells ring!</poem5>
<poem4>And round about the lighted Pool</poem4>
<poem5>We gambol, dance, and sing!</poem5>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem2>Who comes next?</poem2>
<poem3>'Tis the First Gold Stick!</poem3>
<poem2>With the First Cock'd Hat!</poem2>
<poem3>And the First General Brick!</poem3>
<poem2>In the Pool they toss their darlings--</poem2>
<poem3>Sword--hat--stick--garniture!</poem3>
<poem2>And retire to the allegro</poem2>
<poem3>Of the Minuet de la Cour!</poem3>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem2>But while they caper back,</poem2>
<poem3>Three Slaves-to-Dress advance,</poem3>
<poem2>In splendid, killing curls and rouge,--</poem2>
<poem3>The last bright thought of France!</poem3>
<poem2>They say "'Tis Christmas time;</poem2>
<poem3>To the Round Game we will come;</poem3>
<poem2>Let us throw away our fashions,</poem2>
<poem3>And--for once--' let's look at home! '"</poem3>
<poem4>While gingle! tinkle! gingle!</poem4>
<poem5>How the street bells ring!</poem5>
<poem4>And round about the lighted Pool</poem4>
<poem5>We gambol, dance, and sing!</poem5>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem2>But who comes now?</poem2>
<poem3>'Tis the Bishop in his carriage,</poem3>
<poem2>Whose shoulders bear the pain and pride</poem2>
<poem3>Of Church and State's mis-marriage:</poem3>
<poem2>A huge bale of lawn and purple</poem2>
<poem3>He heaves into the Pool,</poem3>
<poem2>And, nodding to his coachman,</poem2>
<poem3>Trips off, relieved and cool!</poem3>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem2>The Millionnaire comes next,</poem2>
<poem3>With a loan to help a war,</poem3>
<poem2>On the wrong side of all justice--</poem2>
<poem3>And his "interest"--not so sure,</poem3>
<poem2>He inflates--and he collapses--</poem2>
<poem3>His mind grows sick and dim--</poem3>
<poem2>Oh, the pangs of breeding money '--</poem2>
<poem3>His loan flutters o'er the brim!</poem3>
<poem4>With gingle! tinkle! gingle!</poem4>
<poem5>How the sweet bells ring!</poem5>
<poem4>As round about the lighted Pool</poem4>
<poem5>We gambol, dance, and sing!</poem5>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem2>Who is this in red and gold?</poem2>
<poem3>'Tis the Soldier with his sword,</poem3>
<poem2>And riding on a cannon</poem2>
<poem3>Bedizen'd, bless'd, adored!</poem3>
<poem2>Round his neck he wears a chain,</poem2>
<poem3>For a show and a pretence,</poem3>
<poem2>But engraved with fiery letters</poem2>
<poem3>Claiming blind obedience:</poem3>
<poem2>His pride and bane are loosed--</poem2>
<poem3>They fly o'er the holly fence!</poem3>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem2>Next, a Lawyer, with his costs--</poem2>
<poem3>Making full a thousand pounds,</poem3>
<poem2>With a score of breaking hearts,</poem2>
<poem3>And live years of waste and wounds.</poem3>
<poem2>His face is cold and wretched--</poem2>
<poem3>His life is but a span--</poem3>
<poem2>A red tape-worm, at the best,</poem2>
<poem3>In a black coat stuff'd with bran:</poem3>
<poem2>He tosses o'er his bill of costs!--</poem2>
<poem3>He is quite another man!</poem3>
<poem4>With gingle! tinkle! gingle!</poem4>
<poem5>How the street bells ring!</poem5>
<poem4>And round about, the lighted Pool</poem4>
<poem5>We gambol, dance, and sing!</poem5>
</poem>
<poem>
<poem2>The Merchant brings his bargain,</poem2>
<poem3>Which would beggar half a town;--</poem3>
<poem2>The Schemer shows a "spec,"</poem2>
<poem3>But deserves each good man's frown;</poem3>
<poem2>The Scholar brings his book,</poem2>
<poem3>Where his soul, all moulting, lies;</poem3>
<poem2>The Poet brings his laurel</poem2>
<poem3>And his castle in the skies;</poem3>
<poem2>The Lover brings his mistress</poem2>
<poem3>Who has treated him with scorn;</poem3>
<poem2>The Shepherd brings his favourite lamb,</poem2>
<poem3>With its curly fleece unshorn;</poem3>
<poem2>All these into the Pool</poem2>
<poem3>Are cast, with various smarts,</poem3>
<poem2>As valued Christmas Offerings,</poem2>
<poem3>Inspired with Christmas hearts!</poem3>
<poem4>While gingle! tinkle! gingle!</poem4>
<poem5>How the sweet bells ring!</poem5>
<poem4>And round about the lighted Pool!</poem4>
<poem5>We gambol, dance, and sing!</poem5>
</poem>
<p>
[The crowd of players at the Game, having joined hands in this concluding dance, now whirl round the Pool of Ice, gambolling and singing; and they continue to do this, till the charm begins to work, and the heat of the Christmas hearts outside causes the Offering which each has thrown in, to warm to such a genial glow, that the heat thus collectively generated, melts the ice. The Pool gradually dissolves the players of the game, one after another, sink down exhausted, and fall into a delightful reverie,; while the melted Pool overflows, and floats every one of them to his home, as he seems to lie in a mother-of-pearl boat, with a branch of holly at the prow, and a coloured lamp amidst the green leaves and red berries. Each one, soon after, recovers his senses just enough to find himself lying comfortably in bed, and listening to the waits!]
