Text and epub versions of Mrs Lirriper's Lodgings and Mrs Lirriper's Legacy

Trying recently to find a ebook copy of the Mrs Lirriper stories by Charles Dickens i found that the versions on Project Gutenberg contained ONLY the Dicken's bits and not the other 80%.

I tried my usual place, archive.org, which had copies but the downloadable epubs there have had no user input and are generally terrible. Dickens Journals Online has copies (see below) that have been transcribed by human volunteers, but only in very plain text.

I have some experience, and the patience, of turning plain text into epubs so i figured i'd make them available.

Unfortunately, the 1864 copy on both Dickens Journals Online and archive.org is missing pages 15-34 which means that the text is also missing from the epub and text version.

I found a copy here http://dspace.wbpublibnet.gov.in:8080/jspui/handle/10689/5466 but that is missing pages 28 and 29

I found another copy here https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/ttu-ir/handle/2346/46624 which is complete (in fact two of the pages are duplicates). 

I started manually transcribing the missing pages, typing them in, but didn't get far before wondering if there was a better way.

So I saved the relevant pages as png files, ran them through tesseract-ocr (which got about 90% of the characters) and fixed them up, combined them with the txt pages from DJO, sanity checked the entire thing with a spell-checker and visually, adding italics where they appeared in the original, et voila.
