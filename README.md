- Doctor Marigold's Prescriptions (1865) - complete

("draft" generally means that i've done the conversion to epub but haven't read it to check)

Trying recently to find a ebook copy of the Mrs Lirriper stories by Charles Dickens i found that the versions on Project Gutenberg contained ONLY the Dicken's bits and not the other 80%.

The same is true of a lot of the other Christmas editions of All The Year Round so i thought i'd do something about it. I used mainly Dickens Journals Online's scanned, OCRed, corrected text (http://www.djo.org.uk/)(i transcribed some of these myself back in the day), but they aren't perfect, so it's a lot of work. (One of them was even missing a couple of pages so i had to find them on some Indian government website. These were scans, which i OCRed myself using Tesseract.)

Everything got converted to lowest common denomiator .txt format, then marked up as xml and then converted to simple epubs using my own acdepub2 code. Finally i generated generic covers using svg templates and Gimp.

next up, Household Words, 1851-1858...
